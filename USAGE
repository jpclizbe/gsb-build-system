To get started:

cd bin/gsb_update
./gsb_update.pl --dl --edit --build=foo
cd -
cd src
./GSB.SlackBuild


Explanation of gsb_update:

--dl:         downloads all the source tarballs into their own dir
--edit:       edits the VERSION and BUILD variables in the SlackBuilds to
              match what was downloaded by --dl
--build=foo   Appends 'foo' to the end of all BUILD variables. This creates
              packages with this naming convention: gtk+2-2.7.1-i486-1foo.tgz
