GNOME SlackBuild -current
-------------------------

WARNING: upgradepkg glib2 gtk+2 GConf before other upgrading other packages.
Take care not to miss new packages that were split from old ones: 
   "upgradepkg --install-new" is (as always) the safest approach.  

gsb-current is a snapshot of the active GNOME SlackBuild development tree.  It
is intended to give developers (and other Linux gurus) a chance to test out the
latest packages for GNOME SlackBuild.  The feedback we get will allow us to make
the next stable release better than ever.

See the ChangeLog.txt for a list of changes in gsb-current.

Please note that the code in this directory is unstable.  It might be
inconsistent about which version of the Slackware packages are required, could
be incomplete because it's in the process of being uploaded, or might not work
for other reasons.  In most cases, we know about these things and are working
to correct them, but still -- feel free to point out the bugs.

Production use is AT YOUR OWN RISK and is not recommended.  OK?

Security is NOT GUARANTEED.  In -current, forward progress often takes
priority.  Security fixes take time and resources, and would often have to be
done more than once.  It's more efficient to build the system and secure it as
time permits and/or the development cycle nears completion.

We do not promise to issue security advisories for gsb-current.

gsb-current might DELETE FILES WITHOUT WARNING when packages are upgraded.
(If, for example, a directory location is replaced by a symbolic link to a new
location.)  Upgrade packages carefully.  Examine incoming updates first if your
machine's data is not expendable.  Again, we do not recommend using
Slackware-current to store or process valuable data.  It is a system in
testing, not one that is ready to go (though often it does work just fine...
BUT DON'T COUNT ON IT) 

Enjoy! :)
