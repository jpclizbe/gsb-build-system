Full rebuild of GNOME SlackBuild 2.26.3 for Slackware64 13.0 RC2.  GNOME
SlackBuild has gone under a directory restructuring to bring it more into line
with Slackware's own practice.  All our packages have been assigned to sets
now, along with tagfiles.  This will help us to develop a Slackware type
installer for GNOME SlackBuild as well as still being able to offer a slapt-get
based installation.
