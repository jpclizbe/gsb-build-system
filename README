GNOME SlackBuild - GSB
----------------------

GNOME SlackBuild (GSB) is a build system to produce a GNOME desktop environment
for Slackware Linux.

The majority of the SlackBuild scripts are the official GNOME SlackBuilds that
shipped with previous versions of Slackware.  SlackBuilds are (slowly) being
updated and cleaned up.

Usage
-----
FIXME: This needs to be updated

cd bin/gsb_update
./gsb_update.pl --dl --edit --build=foo
cd -
cd src
./GSB.SlackBuild


Explanation of gsb_update:

--dl:         downloads all the source tarballs into their own dir
--edit:       edits the VERSION and BUILD variables in the SlackBuilds to
              match what was downloaded by --dl
--build=foo   Appends 'foo' to the end of all BUILD variables. This creates
              packages with this naming convention: gtk+2-2.7.1-i486-1foo.tgz
