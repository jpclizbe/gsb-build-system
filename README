GSB - GNOME SlackBuild
    - run one script -> out come slackware packages for a
      GNOME release

http://gsb.sf.net

The majority of the .SlackBuild scripts are just the official gnome
.build scripts that ship in the official slackware source tree. There
are also some .SlackBuilds related to gnome from Slackware included here.
COPYING.slackware reflects the copyright on those scripts.

The rest are under the COPYING license, although currently under the GPL, I'll
probably change this to a BSD license like the COPYING.slackware file
