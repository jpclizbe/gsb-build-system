This product includes Mono C# software developed by Novell, Inc. 

Parts of Mono are dual licensed, they are available to the
public in GPL or LGPL forms, but Novell, Inc also offer those 
pieces under commercial terms from Novell for when the GPL and the
LGPL are not suitable.

Novell has tried to pick the licenses that will maximize adoption
of Mono, so they tend to use the MIT X11 or LGPL liceses.

Contributions to dual-licensed module require that the author
contributes the code under the terms of the MIT X11 code, or
to sign an agreement that allows Novell to redistribute the
code under other licenses.

Contributions for other modules should be under the same license
terms as the rest of the module, or under MIT X11 terms. 

If you need further information, please contact mono@novell.com, or
consult the LICENSE and COPYING.LIB in /usr/doc/mono

Although every effort has been made to provide a complete source tree for this
project, it's possible that something may have been forgotten.  If you discover
anything is missing, we will provide copies - just ask!

NOTE: We are required to provide any missing source to GPLv2'ed software for
3 years, per this section of the GNU General Public License:

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

We are also required to do the above, or provide access to copy the source that
corresponds to your binaries from a network server in the case of materials
which are licensed under the GPLv3 (see COPYING3 for the complete license).

If you find something is missing online (even if you don't need a copy),
please point it out to our gsb-devel mailing list so it can be fixed.
