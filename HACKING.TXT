			     Notes for hackers
			     =================

* Before starting to hack it's a good idea to stop by #gsb on irc.freenode.net
  to discuss the changes or work you'd like to make - we do have plans for the
  future development of the project, so make sure your changes won't conflict
  with our plans.

* Unless you have git commit access we will require an 'git diff' of your
  changes to the tree.  Please use 'git diff' - we cannot work with the
  output of a simple 'diff'.  Mail the diff to the gsb-dev mailing list.

* Patches should have descriptive names, eg: fix-broken-something.patch.
  If a patch is ARCH specific it should include the architecture it is
  intended for in the filename.  eg: i586.fix-broken-something.patch.
  If a patch can be used on multiple architectures (like i586, i686 etc)
  a symlink should be used from the original filename to each of the arch
  specific names.

* Commit log messages should be descriptive.

* Keep the VERSIONS file up to date.

* Keep the ChangeLog up to date.

* Credit yourself in CREDITS.
