GNOME SlackBuild (GSB) has two components; a full and complete system to build
Slackware compliant packages from GNOME sources, and a binary distribution of
those pre-built packages, suitable for Slackware and Slamd64.

This document provides information on using the GSB build system to produce
your own packages of GNOME.  Included in the GSB build system are all the
SlackBuilds and required files to build a package, an automatic source
downloader (we do not distribute the GNOME sources with GSB) and several other
tools which are used to create a binary tree of GSB.

For detailed information on the build process, or how to obtain the pre-built
GSB packages (which, in most cases, is far far easier than trying to build GSB
yourself), please see the website at:

**********************************************************************************

1. Before You Begin
--------------------

This version of GSB is designed to build packages using:
  Slackware 12.1
  Slamd64 12.1

If you are trying to build GSB on systems other than the above you *will*
encounter problems during the build.

We cannot offer any form of support to users trying to build GSB on earlier 
versions of Slackware or Slamd64.  However, if you do manage to get GSB built
on other versions, please let us know what modifications you had to make to the
build system in order to do so - if those changes can be integrated into our
build system, you may find those versions supported out of the box in our
future releases.

The developers use a strictly controled base of packages to build the binary
packages for the project - we only install the minimum packages required to
perform a build.  We work from a set of 'tagfiles' which specify exactly which
packages get installed into our build environment.  We have included our
tagfiles set in the lib/gsb/tagfiles/ directory for reference.

When it comes to building your own packages it is doubtfull your build will
succeed if you do not have every package marked with an "ADD" in our tagfiles
installed on your system.  Those packages marked "ADD" form the basis of our
build requirements - any missing packages from your system will likely cause
the build to fail.  If you have a full installation of Slackware or Slamd64 you
should not have any problem doing a build, but the resulting packages may have
more dependancies than indicated in our slack-required files (because many of
the sources will find extra libraries when being configured and automatically
link against them).

Unless you really know what you are doing with packages, understand what
tagfiles and dependancies are all about, and really feel the need to "roll
your own", it would be a far far better choice for you to download the
pre-built binaries and install those.


2. Obtaining the GNOME SlackBuild Source
----------------------------------------

We currently maintain several SVN branches to produce our GSB releases.  The
following is a list of our trees and the URIs which should be used to 'svn co'
one of them before building. 

Bleeding edge 'gsb-current' tree:
  (At the time of writing, GNOME 2.24.0)
  http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/trunk/

  This tree contains the latest and most up to date GSB sources.  As such, at
  any time it may be broken (ie, will not build fully) or may cause your system
  to explode in a shower of wires and capacitors if you run it.
  This tree is usually only for the latest Slackware/Slamd64 current and may
  not work on other releases.

GNOME 2.22 tree:
  http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/branches/gsb-2.22/

  This is our GNOME 2.22.3 stable tree for Slackware 12.1 and Slamd64 12.1.
  This tree is kept up to date with the GNOME 2.22.3 sources and will be
  maintained (at least for the short->medium timeframe) with the minor
  2.22.x releases GNOME provide.

GNOME 2.20 tree:
  http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/branches/gsb-2.20/

  This is our GNOME 2.20 stable tree for Slackware and Slamd64 12.0 ONLY.
  This tree is kept up to date with the GNOME 2.20 sources and will be
  maintained (at least for the short->medium timeframe) with the minor
  2.20.x releases GNOME provide.


3. Quick Start Guide
---------------------

You must be root in order to build GSB.

You must be running one of the supported build platforms and have all the
required dependancies installed (see above) to build GSB.

The GNOME (etc) source files are not distributed with GSB - part of the build
process will download the source files for you.  Obviously you need an (active)
internet connection to download the sources.

Here's what to do:
  $ ./bin/gsb_update.pl --dl --edit --build=gsb
  $ cd src/
  $ ./gsb.SlackBuild

Downloading the sources (gsb_update.pl) may take a while depending on the speed
of your internet connection.  Don't be surprised if it takes a few hours :)

The '--dl' option to gsb_update tells it to download the required sources.
Without this option nothing will be downloaded.  You can stop and start the
process as much as you like - gsb_update will not re-download sources it has
downloaded previously.  With '--edit', gsb_update will edit the SlackBuild
files with the version information from the source downloaded - you want this.
Finally, '--build=gsb' provides a build tag for the packages.  You can specify
any build tag you wish for your packages - we use 'gsb' to mark ours.  If no
'--build' option is given, no tag is added to the BUILD and the built packages
will be named just like standard packages (and thus very difficult to remove
once installed).

The build is started by running './gsb.SlackBuild' in the src/ directory.  The
gsb.SlackBuild script has several options which effect the whole build process.
Normally, however, none of those options are required for a build; and you are
advised *not* to use them unless you are a developer.  The options are
explained in detail further down in this document.

GSB requires that some standard Slackware/Slamd64 packages be upgraded to newer
versions in order for other packages to compile and work correctly.  As part of
the GSB build process, gsb.SlackBuild (and section SlackBuilds) will remove
(using removepkg) any such packages which need to be updated.  The new
(updated) package from GSB will then be built and installed.

Building GSB will take a very long time unless you have some top-notch hardware
or small cluster system.  It took 1-2 days to perform a full build of GSB on
my build box (2.5GHz CPU, 2GB RAM) - you have been warned.

If the build fails for some reason, you can correct the error and re-run the
'./gsb.SlackBuild' command - the build system will continue from where it
failed, not restart the whole process again.

At the end of the build process you will have a full copy of GSB installed on
your system ready to go, and a copy of the completed GSB binary package tree
in /tmp/gsb-tree/ (see below for how to change this).


4. Starting GSB/GNOME
-----------------------

Starting the GSB GNOME environment will depend on how you start your current X
Window environment.  Both techniques are described below.

If you login to your system at the text console and use 'startx' or similar,
you should log in as your usual (not root!) user and run:
  $ xwmconfig
... and select the GNOME option from the menu.
You can also repeat the above as root to set the default for the whole system,
but using root as your every day login user is a *really* *stupid* *idea*.

Secondly, if you login to your system via a graphical login manager (such as
kdm, xdm or other) you will need to exit the graphical login manager in order
to allow gdm (the GNOME graphical login manager) to take over.

To get gdm up and running you need to be at a text console [yes, an Xterm
will work but you'll have to re-login after X Windows exits - it's just easier
to do it this way, trust me]:  hold down Ctl and Alt and press F6 once.
After a couple of seconds you should see a text based "login" prompt.

At the text "login" prompt, login to your system as root and then run:
  $ init 3
... and wait for the system to close all of the X Window processes and return
you to the usual prompt.  It may take up to a minute to do this, and try
hitting Enter a couple of times to see when it's done.

Once back to the prompt, run:
  $ init 4
... and wait for the new gdm graphical login manager to appear.

You can now login to your new GSB GNOME desktop.  Make sure you select "GNOME"
from the session selection menu, if it is not already the default.

If you are returned to the prompt or your display keeps going on and off
repeatidly, the gdm application has not started sucessfully and there is a
problem.  You will need to return your system to the text based state in order
to debug the problem - use the same 'init 3' command as detailed above.

If you do have a problem like this or cannot figure out what the issue is,
please visit us on the IRC channel for help - details are on the website.




APPENDIX A. Customising the Build Environment
---------------------------------

When building GSB, there are several environment variables which can be used to
tweak and customise the build process.  GSB supports two methods of setting
these environment variables, described below.

The first option is to use the bash builtin 'export' to manually set the option
and export it to all sub-processes.  This can be done with a command like:
  $ export VAR="VAL"
... which can be repeated for as many environment options as you want to set.

You must remember to set these options every time you begin a build process as
they will not be saved accross multiple builds.

The second option is to create a 'gsb.options' file in the src/ directory.
The gsb.options file is read at the begining of every build process, and the
options specified in this file will be saved accross multiple builds.
Using the gsb.options file is especially useful for repeat builds or for
developers who want to set specific options when testing.

The gsb.options file should contain exactly the same 'export' commands which
would be used manually on the command line (see above).  The advantage of
putting them into the gsb.options file is that the options will always be read,
no matter whether you remember to manually export them on the command line.

Here are the common environment variables which can be set to effect, tweak
or customise the build process:

ARCH
  Setting the ARCH allows you to over-ride the default base architecture type
  for GSB.  You can use this environment option to build GSB for, say, x86_64
  or the powerpc architecture type.  The architecture type set when building
  GSB determines the absolute minimum processor type required to run the
  produced binaries.  In other words, if you set ARCH=i686 the resulting code
  will NOT work on an i586 or earlier CPU.
  These ARCH types are currently recognised by the GSB SlackBuild scripts:
    i386, i486, i586, i686, x86_64 and powerpc.
  The default is "i586".
	
TUNE
  This option is very similar to the ARCH environment option except that the
  resulting binaries are scheduler-tuned to the given processor type.  This
  means that the binaries will be tuned to run with better performance on the
  CPU type specified with TUNE, but will still work without problems on CPU
  types going back to the value specified for ARCH.
  TUNE can be set to any valid CPU type within the architecture type specified
  with ARCH.  For example, if ARCH=i586, TUNE could be set to i686.
  For an ARCH type of x86_64, TUNE must be set to one of the 64 bit processor
  types, currently: k8, opteron, athlon64 and athlon-fx.
  The default is "i586", except for an ARCH type of x86_64 where it is "k8".

DISTRO
  Setting DISTRO to anything other than "slackware" allows GSB to be built on
  different (Slackware based) distributions.  For example, this can be set to
  "slamd64" when building GSB on the 64 bit Slackware based distro Slamd64.
  The default is "slackware", and should not be over-ridden unless you are
  specifically building for another distribution.

TMP
  During the package builds, temporary data will need to be stored on disk.
  This option specifies the directory where that temporary data can be written.
  Make sure the default (or any directory you specify) has enough free space
  for the build process, plus the completed packages and logs.
  The default is "/tmp".

PKGDEST
  Once a package has been built, it will be stored in a sub directory of the
  path specified with this option.  The default for this option is affected by
  the value of the TMP environment variable (referred to as $TMP below).
  The default is "$TMP/gsb-tree", except for an ARCH type of x86_64 where it is
  "$TEMP/gsb64-tree".

LOGSDIR
  As the GSB build process proceeds, a log of the output from each package
  build is logged for later debugging.  This environment option specifies the
  directory where these log files will be stored.
  This option is not used by individual package SlackBuilds but is used by the
  top-level SlackBuilds which control the build processes.  The default for
  this option is affected by the value of the TMP environment option detailed
  above (referred to as $TMP below).
  The default is "$TMP/gsb-buildlogs".

The following options are less common but allow highly specific customisation
of the build process.  You should not set these options unless you know exactly
what needs to be set for each.

GSB_SECTIONS
  This environment option can be used to specify exactly what GSB sections
  should be processed.  This option should contain a space separated list of
  (valid) GSB sections (available using the '--list' option to gsb.SlackBuild),
  in the order they should be processed.  Care should be taken to insure the
  processing order is correct - packages in some sections rely on packages
  previously built in others.
  The default is to process all GSB sections (in the correct order).
  
GSB_CONFIGURE_FLAGS
  Any options specified in this environment variable are ADDED to the package
  specific options passed to the ./configure command in the SlackBuilds.
  If this option is set globally (ie, set with export or in gsb.options) it
  sets the additional options passed to ./configure for EVERY SlackBuild in
  GSB.  Therefore, mkae sure that any setting given in this environment option
  is valid for EVERY ./configure used in GSB.
  When ARCH=x86_64, ./configure is automatically passed "--libdir=/usr/lib64".

GSB_TUNE_CFLAGS
  This environment option allows you to set the specific tuning options gcc
  should use when compiling/linking the binaries in packages.  There are many,
  many gcc options which can be set to optimise/tune the binaries - see the gcc
  man page for full details.  Setting this option over-rides the default tuning
  options specified in the SlackBuild files - these options are NOT added to
  the default ones.  Make sure you add any of the default options from the
  SlackBuilds back to this environment option if you choose to use it.
  Tuning is specific to each ARCH, with the defaults being:
    i386, i486: -O3 -march=$ARCH -mtune=$TUNE
    i586, i686: -O3 -march=$ARCH -mtune=$TUNE -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer 
    x86_64, with default TUNE: -O3 -march=k8 -mtune=k8 -pipe \
                               -fomit-frame-pointer -fPIC
    x86_64, with custom TUNE: -O3 -march=$TUNE -mtune=$TUNE -pipe \
                              -fomit-frame-pointer -fPIC
    powerpc: -O2 -march=$ARCH

GSB_EXTRA_CFLAGS
  This setting is used to add custom/additional gcc options to be used during
  the compiling/linking phase.  As with the above, there are many options which
  can be used with gcc and the best place to look for these is the man page.
  Setting this option over-rides the default extra options specified in the
  SlackBuild files - these options are NOT added to the default ones.  Make
  sure you add any of the default options from the SlackBuilds back to this
  environment option if you choose to use it.
  There is no default for this option.

GSB_MAKE_FLAGS
  Using this environment option allows additional command line arguments and/or
  options to be given to the "make" command when building the sources.  This
  option may be useful for people with multi core/processor machines which can
  perform parallel builds using an option such as "-j2" or "-j4".  See the man
  page for make for full details of command line arguments and options.
  Setting this option over-rides the default make arguments specified in the
  SlackBuild files - these options are NOT added to the default ones.  Make
  sure you add any of the default arguments from the SlackBuilds back to this
  environment option if you choose to use it.
  There is no default for this option.




APPENDIX B. SlackBuild Arguments
----------------------------------

There are several options which can be passed to gsb.SlackBuild when begining
the build process.  Options given to a top-level SlackBuild will be passed
down to the individual package Slackbuilds as a the build process continues.

The following options are recognised:
  --help		Show this help screen.

  --list		List the packages which will be built in this section.

  --force		A package will not be built if a package of the same
			name is already installed, or any of the pre-requisite
			packages are not installed.  This option over-rides
			the checks and attempts a build (which will probably
			fail) anyway.

  --no-cleanup		By default, any source, temporary build and package
			directories will be deleted once the package is built.
			This option prevents those files from being removed.

  --no-patchesdir	When rebuilding packages which already exist in the
			main package directory, the default is to put the new
			packages in the patches directory.  Using this option
			completely disables the use of a patches directory.

  --no-skip		During the build process, packages that are up to date
			(ie, the package version and build numbers match the
			coresponding SlackBuild) will not be rebuilt.  This
			option forces packages to be rebuilt regardless of the
			version and build numbers.  This option doesn't affect
			the pre-build checks for installed packages (see the
			--force option).  This option implies --no-patchesdir.

  --no-prune		Normally, when a package is built and copied to the
			destination directory (whether it be the main package 
			directory or the patches directory), any previous
			package(s) of the same name in that directory are
			deleted - it is assumed the new package is to replace
			any which are already present.  This option prevents
			previous packages being deleted, possibly leaving more
			than one package of the same name (but with different
			version or build numbers) laying around.

  --no-install		Build the packages but don't install them afterwards.
			This should only be used for testing as it WILL cause
			serious problems - most builds rely on other GSB
			packages being automatically installed first.

  --no-metafiles	Do not create the package's .txt and .md5 meta files
			which would usually be produced during a build.

-- 
Good luck!
