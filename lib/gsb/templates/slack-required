# Required packages are those that are specifically needed for this particular
# package to operate correctly. eg, 'spamassassin' requires the 'perl' package.
#
# Packages must be listed one per line and are case sensitive. If multiple
# packages can satisfy the requirement (such as 'openssl' or 'openssl-solibs')
# the packages should be listed as: <pkg1> | <pkg2> [...]
#
# Package version checking can be done using  =  >=  =<  <  >  operators, but
# versions must be the full Slackware version string. eg, 1.2.3-i486-1 .
