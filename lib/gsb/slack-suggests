# Version: 0.1.0
# Suggested packages are those that may be beneficial or provide extra features
# or functionality to this package. For example, 'php' provides extra features
# to the 'apache' web server package, thus making it a good suggestion.
#
# Packages should be listed one per line and are case sensitive. If multiple
# packages can satisfy a suggestion (such as 'openssl' or 'openssl-solibs')
# the packages should be listed as: <pkg1> | <pkg2> [...]
