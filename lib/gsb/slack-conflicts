# Version: 0.1.0
# Packages which may cause conflicts with other packages should be listed here.
# For example, 'lprng' will conflict with 'cups' as they are both printing
# sub-systems.  Therefore, 'lprng' would need to be listed as a conflict in
# the 'cups' package.
#
# Packages should be listed one per line and are case sensitive.
