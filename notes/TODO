## Random Notes: Jotted here for a later web site page? FAQ?  :)
##

* To get proper scoring working with gnome-games, you have to add user name
  to group "games".

* Users need to add themselves to the "netdev" group in order to get Network
  Manager running properly.  There is a brief note in the doinst.sh for the 
  package, but they might miss it.  Should be made clear in a FAQ.

* gnome-volume-control will whine about "No Audio Device" if the user is
  not in the group "audio"

* network-manager-applet, beagle, tracker, etc, are all disabled by default.
  (Well, according to us, anyways...  :)   Users can either globally re-enable
  them by copying nm-applet.desktop, beagle-search-autostart.desktop, 
  beagled-autostart.desktop, trackerd.desktop, etc to the /usr/share/gnome/autostart
  directory, or else on a user-level by copying the .desktop files into their
  ~/.config/autostart directory.  (They will need to make it if it doesn't exist
  already)

* compiz:  Doesn't have an xinitrc written for it yet. Will have to do that.  
  Also, will need to write a gdm session file.  If they want compiz to autostart
  they can put "compiz-manager" in their session startup (through GNOME Control
  Panel), or else within the .config/autostart directory, ln -s /usr/bin/compiz-manager

## Some Things to Consider
## 

* Pulseaudio.  Should we be adding the system-wide groups?  Or should
  we leave the user to do so if he/she chooses to implement the daemon
  in that fashion?

* System-backend-tools.  Is this really necessary for Slackware systems?
  Will look into it some more.  Major configurations are always best done
  by hand.  :)  Currently, stb is installed, and the daemon is setup to start
  up (Nautilus looks for it), but is largely unconfigured.  This is the 
  next major task.  :)

### 
### Package Ideas 
###

* Fonts package: <http://eyegene.ophthy.med.umich.edu/unicode/fontguide/>


###
### Website Ideas
###
* Package browser based on PACKAGES.TXT
  --> This is a huge undertaking...and task is up for grabs :)
* Include/Enclose "replaced_packages" in code block, like TODO (where?).
* Write website dev/admin documentation (in progress)
* Make ViewVC link more prominent in dev. section.
* Need more screeshots!!!
* Rewrite download/install page when ready.

###
### Misc
###
* make sure to change the db.h symlink to db4
    -->  is this step needed anymore with Slackware 12?
* add --cleanup to gsb.SlackBuild as an arg so that users with limited disk
  space can build GSB without leaving around the package-foo and source dirs
    -->  done, cleans up by default.  need to specify --no-cleanup to prevent.
* slack-required files:
	- suggested by malloc;
        ldd /usr/sbin/slapt-get |grep \
          '=>'|awk '{print $3}'|sed  \
          "s/^\///"|xargs -i grep -l {} \
          /var/log/packages/*|xargs -i basename {}|sed -re \
          "s/(.*{1,})\\-(.*[\\.\\-].*[\\.\\-].*)/\1 >= \2/"
     --> this is a nifty idea, but perhaps manual control over slack-desc is
         better for the moment.  :)
