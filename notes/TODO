## Random Notes: Jotted here for a later web site page? FAQ?  :)
##

*  To get proper scoring working with gnome-games, you have to be a member
   of group "games".  Add a FAQ about this?

*  Users need to be members of group "netdev" in order to get Network Manager
   running properly.  There is a brief note in the doinst.sh for the package,
   but most people will miss it during an install.  Add a FAQ about this?

*  gnome-volume-control will give an error such as "No Audio Device" if the
   user is not a member of group "audio".  Add a FAQ about this?

*  network-manager-applet, beagle, tracker, etc, are all disabled by default in
   GSB.  Any/all of these applications can be enabled globally by copying
   nm-applet.desktop, beagle-search-autostart.desktop,
   beagled-autostart.desktop, trackerd.desktop, etc to the
   /usr/share/gnome/autostart directory.  Alternatively individual users can
   enable them by copying the above files into their ~/.config/autostart
   directory (which will need to be created if it doesn't exist already).
   Add a FAQ about this?

*  Administrative utilities, like time-date-admin, shares-admin, sabayon, etc
   etc, will complain that the user doesn't have the proper rights to change
   the settings.  If you use these applications enough on a regular basis
   to warrant keeping them in the menu, and you would like a prompt for a root
   password, edit the menu entry (using Alacarte, right click on the GNOME
   menu, then right click on properties), and append "gksu" to the command.

*  compiz doesn't have an xinitrc written for it yet - needs to be done in time
   for stable release.  Also, will need to write a gdm session file.
   If you want compiz to autostart, put "compiz-manager" in the session startup
   (through GNOME Control Panel), or add it to the autostart directory:
     $ (mkdir -p .config/autostart ; cd .config/autostart ; \
        ln -s /usr/bin/compiz-manager . )

## Some Things to Consider
## 

*  Pulseaudio.  Should we be adding the system-wide groups?  Or should
   we leave the user to do so if he/she chooses to implement the daemon
   in that fashion?

*  System-backend-tools.  Is this really necessary for Slackware systems?
   Will look into it some more.  Major configurations are always best done
   by hand.  :)  Currently, stb is installed, and the daemon is setup to start
   up (Nautilus looks for it), but is largely unconfigured.  This is the 
   next major task.  :)


### 
### Package Ideas 
###

*  Fonts package: <http://eyegene.ophthy.med.umich.edu/unicode/fontguide/>


###
### Website Ideas
###

*  Package browser based on PACKAGES.TXT
    --> This is a huge undertaking...and task is up for grabs :)
*  Include/Enclose "replaced_packages" in code block, like TODO (where?).
*  Write website dev/admin documentation
    --> Done
*  Make ViewVC link more prominent in dev. section.
    --> Done
*  Need more screeshots!!!
*  Rewrite download/install page when ready.
    - System Req. section in proposed download/install page
*  Convert entire site from en_US en_GB...
   As of now, it's inconsistent; and en_GB is more understood by non-EN folks.
*  On Build page:  add some tyoe of "requirements" section, and note that
   some packages actually require a net connection to build, etc.


###
### Misc
###

*  make sure to change the db.h symlink to db4
    -->  Is this step needed anymore with Slackware 12?
    -->  No, it's not; but gsb.SlackBuild makes sure the link is correct. ~DA.
*  add --cleanup to gsb.SlackBuild as an arg so that users with limited disk
   space can build GSB without leaving around the package-foo and source dirs
    -->  done, cleans up by default.  need to specify --no-cleanup to prevent.
*  slack-required files:
    - suggested by malloc;
        ldd /usr/sbin/slapt-get |grep \
          '=>'|awk '{print $3}'|sed  \
          "s/^\///"|xargs -i grep -l {} \
          /var/log/packages/*|xargs -i basename {}|sed -re \
          "s/(.*{1,})\\-(.*[\\.\\-].*[\\.\\-].*)/\1 >= \2/"
      --> this is a nifty idea, but perhaps manual control over slack-desc is
          better for the moment.  :)
