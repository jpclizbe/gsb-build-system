## Some Notes to Add to Website Perhaps? FAQ?

To get proper scoring working with gnome-games, you have to add user name
to group "games"

## Some Things to Consider
## 

Pulseaudio.  Should we be adding the system-wide groups?  Or should
we leave the user to do so if he/she chooses to implement the daemon
in that fashion?



Package ideas:
  * Fonts package
      http://eyegene.ophthy.med.umich.edu/unicode/fontguide/

  * mozilla-nss libs for people who do not want mozilla installed - done!

Website idead:
  * Package browser based on PACKAGES.TXT.

* make sure to change the db.h symlink to db4
* add --cleanup to GSB.SlackBuild as an arg so that users with limited disk
  space can build GSB without leaving around the package-foo and source dirs
* slack-required files:
	- suggested by malloc
		ldd /usr/sbin/slapt-get |grep '=>'|awk '{print $3}'|sed "s/^\///"|xargs -i grep -l {} /var/log/packages/*|xargs -i basename {}|sed -re "s/(.*{1,})\\-(.*[\\.\\-].*[\\.\\-].*)/\1 >= \2/"
