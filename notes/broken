mozilla-firefox 2.0.0.12 doesn't seem to want to build with canvas support. 

liboil cannot be build with hyper-optimization, else the resulting library can 
cause segfaults. (Noticed with gstreamer plugins)

gnome-system-tools (network-admin, services, timeadmin), etc are generally broken with Slackware's older version of dbus.
