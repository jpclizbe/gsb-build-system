These are some "mini" projects that (I think) need to be done for GSB.

Scripts:
  Edit BUILD var in SlackBuilds
  Combi installer (local, net, cd)
  Upload script (to rsync tree to server)

Packages:
  cpan-modules - All the perl modules required to use GSB, in one package.
  gsb - A collection of config scripts, settings etc for GSB.

gsb_update:
  A lot of this needs to be re-written and standardised, as well as features
  being added.
  Ideas:
    Ability to delete old sources from the source dirs
    A way to reset the BUILD var back to 1 (per package or for all)
    Ability to increment BUILD var by given number (per package or for all)
