The main "gsb" base module creates and ships with a full Gconf structure already created for 
all its main packages.  All other additional modules which use gconf *MUST* use init scripts 
(perhaps using rc.gsb.S as a template) to merge its private gconf settings into the gsb 
gconf tree, at least once for persistent filesystems (USB), and on every boot for 
non-persistent filesystems (like CDROMs) 

Modules other than the main gsb module SHOULD NOT ship with a /etc/gconf tree, which 
will otherwise clobber the main libgnome tree when mounted by the linux-live scripts.
