The main "gsb" module creates and ships with a created gconf structure
for all its main packages.  All other modules which use gconf *MUST*
use init scripts (perhaps using rc.gsb.S as a template) to merge its
private gconf settings into the gsb gconf tree.  Modules other than 
the main gsb module SHOULD NOT ship with a /etc/gconf tree, which 
will otherwise clobber the main libgnome tree when mounted.
