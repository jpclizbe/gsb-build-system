Quick HOWTO For GNOME SlackBuild 2.24.2 Module for Slax

  * Download Slam 6.0.9.  
       http://www.slax.org/get_slax.php
       NOTE: We have only tested the GSB Slax Module on USB keys.  
       It has not yet been tested on CDs, so don't waste your blank CDs. :^)

  * Untar the slax tar to a working partition on the USB key.
  
  If you're doing this from Linux:
    * Make sure you have the 'rd' (Ramdisk Support) loaded in your 
      running kernel.
      (You may need to run `modprobe rd` to load it.)
    * From the slax partition, run: ./boot/liloinst.sh 
      in order to make the USB key bootable.

  If you're doing this from Windows:
    * Run the liloinst.bat to make the USB key bootable.

  * NOTE: Make sure to run the liloinst script, as this also sets up the
    'changes' directory, which will store any changes you make to your
    filesystems.  Very important if you want to store anything on your USB 
    key after booting.

  * Download the gsb.lzm file and copy it to the slax/modules directory.
      Remember: You must also include the Slax python module.

  * Make sure your computer's BIOS is configured to boot from the USB
    device first.

  * Boot.  Wua!

Good luck!
