		 HOW TO INSTALL GSB: GNOME SlackBuild 2.30
                        (for Slackware/Slackware64 13.1)
                    =======================================

Introduction
-------------

GNOME SlackBuild (GSB) has two components; a full and complete system to build
Slackware compliant packages from GNOME sources, and a binary distribution of
those pre-built packages, suitable for Slackware and Slackware64.

Please give the CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT a quick read before installing.  Also, we
still need to replace five standard Slackware packages.  Please see
SLACKWARE-13.1_REPLACED_PACKAGES.TXT for more details about what needs to be
replaced, and why. 

This document provides information on installing our pre-built GSB packages on
Slackware and Slackware64.  GSB encompasses all needed packages for a fully
configurable, customisable and usable GNOME desktop environment.

If you haven't yet, you should read about the GSB project before installing:
  <http://gnomeslackbuild.org/>

This version of GSB is built and only supported on:
  Slackware 13.1
  Slackware64 13.1

If you are trying to use GSB on systems other than the above you *will*
encounter problems.  If you are running a previous version of Slackware or
Slackware64, you must upgrade.  Do not attempt to install this version of GSB on
previous versions of Slackware and Slackware64.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Any questions or bug reports, please email gsb-dev@googlegroups.com or drop by
the #gsb channel on freenode. 


Quick-Start Installation using Slapt-get
----------------------------------------

If you have not used slapt-get before then you should skip below to the section
marked "Slapt-get Installation Method" and give it a quick read before
proceeding.  

It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest slapt-get before installing or
upgrading GSB.  You can find slapt-get at: 

For Slackware:
  http://www.slackware.org.uk/gsb/gsb-current/gsb/ad/slapt-get-0.10.2d-i486-2gsb.txz

For Slackware64:
  http://www.slackware.org.uk/gsb/gsb64-current/gsb/ad/slapt-get-0.10.2d-x86_64-2gsb.txz

Update your /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc file to point to Slackware 13.1
and GNOMESlackBuild repositories.  Make sure to add the :OFFICIAL tag to
the end of your SOURCE= which points to the Slackware repository, and the
tag :CUSTOM to the SOURCE= line which points to your GNOMESlackBuild
repository.  Without the :CUSTOM tag, the official Slackware packages will
outweigh GSB packages, and not all required packages will be upgraded. 

It it recommended that your drop to single user mode (with networking) before
upgrading your machine or doing a full installation.  It is also wise to reboot
afterward.  For more details, see below "Before Installation"

** UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS INSTALLATION **

For more details, please consult the UPGRADE.TXT.

If you are upgrading your GSB from an earlier version, make sure to
point your /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc SOURCE= to a gsb-current repository.
You can find a list of available mirrors from:
       http://gnomeslackbuild.org/download#mirrors

1. Upgrade slapt-get package and update repository:
      $ slapt-get --update && slapt-get --install slapt-get
2. Add gpg keys:
      $ slapt-get --add-keys
3. Upgrade your packages:
      $ slapt-get --upgrade

** INSTALLING NEW **

If you are installing on a fresh Slackware 13.1 system, then you will need
to grab a copy of slapt-get from the repository (above), and then update
your /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc file.  Afterwards:

1.  Update slapt-get:
       $ slapt-get --update
2.  Update gpg keys:
       $ slapt-get --add-keys
3. Upgrade your packages:
      $ slapt-get --upgrade
4.  Install the GSB desktop via the metapackage:
       $ slapt-get --install gsb-desktop.

All relevant packages will installed or upgraded through this metapackage.
You can then add additional packages if you wish via slapt-get or gslapt
from your new GNOME desktop. 

Other Installation methods
----------------------------

GSB currently supports two other installation methos; a fully automated net 
based installer and installation from a local repository mirror.

The automated net installer, obviously, requires an active internet connection
to perform the installation - packages are downloaded from one of the GSB
mirror sites (randomly selected from our mirrors list) and installed onto the
system automatically.  However, with the net installer there is no facility to
select what packages will be installed - the net installer will install all
packages listed in the 'gsb-complete' meta package (see below).  This is by
far the best option for users who want a fully functional, fully featured
GNOME desktop.

If net installation is not possible or there are many installations to be
performed, GSB can be installed from a local mirror/repository.  This procedure
requires a full local copy of the whole GSB binary tree - either on hard disk,
a CDROM or some other portable media, and follows the same general process as
the manual slapt-get net installation, except that slapt-get is configured
to use a local GSB repository rather than a online one.

Each of the procedures for installation is detailed below.  Once you have
decided which option is best for you, please refer to the appropriate section
for full instructions.

If you regulaly use slapt-get to keep your packages up to date, or have
multiple repositories in your slapt-getrc, it is important that you read the
section titled 'Problems when using slapt-get' below.


Before installation
-------------------

The installation is best done at runlevel 3 - *without* X11 running.  It is not
advisable to do the installation from within an XTerm or Terminal Emulator.

If you have any X11 sessions open which were started with the 'startx' command
(or similar) after you logged into the console in text mode, you must exit
those sessions to insure the installation goes smoothly.  Once those are closed
you will probably be returned to your normal (unprivilged) user account shell
prompt, you should now logout using:
  $ logout

You should now be back at the text based 'login:' prompt.  Skip the next 2
paragraphs nad continue with the procedure.

If your system boots (or has been put) into runlevel 4 (the graphical login
runlevel), you must put the system back into runlevel 3.  Firstly, if you are
in X11, you need to get to a text login console - hold down the Ctl and Alt
keys and press F6.  This will take you to a text based 'login:' prompt, where
you should log in as 'root' using your root password.  Once logged in, use this
command to bring the system back to runlevel 3:
  $ init 3

Wait for the process to finish (it might help to hit Enter a couple of times
after 20-30 seconds).  During the process, your active terminal may be changed,
so you may not be returned to the shell prompt.  If the active terminal has
changed, it will probably now show another 'login:' prompt.  If you are
returned to the shell prompt after hitting Enter a couple of times, you do not
need to log out (and can skip the rest of this section) - you are logged in as
'root' and can begin installation.

In either of the two cases above, if you have a text based 'login:' prompt on
screen, you must login as 'root' using your own root password.

You should now be logged into your system as the 'root' user, your system
should be at runlevel 3, and there should be no active X11 sessions.


Automated net installation
--------------------------

This is the simplest method of installation and requires very little detailed
explanation - you simply run one command and a full installation of GSB, plus
any of the required Slackware/Slackware64 package dependancies, will be
installed.

Depending on whether you have 'wget', 'curl' or 'lynx' available on your
system, you can use one of the following commands to begin installation.  Be
sure to use the correct URI for your architecture - GSB supports both IA32 (32
bit Slackware) and x86_64 (64 bit Slackware64).

Using wget:
  For IA32:
    $ wget -q -O- http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install | bash
  For x86_64:
    $ wget -q -O- http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install/64 | bash

Using curl:
  For IA32:
    $ curl http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install | bash
  For x86_64:
    $ curl http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install/64 | bash

Using lynx:
  For IA32:
    $ lynx --source http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install | bash
  For x86_64:
    $ lynx --source http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install/64 | bash


Slapt-get Installation Method
-----------------------------

Once slapt-get is installed, a basic configuration file must be created for the
installation.  We do not recommend editing your current slapt-get configuration
unless you know what you are doing.  These instructions will create a new, GSB
specific, slapt-getrc file which should be used just for installation and for
future updates.

Before the slapt-getrc file can be created, you must select the GSB and
Slackware/Slackware64 mirrors to be used for the installation.  Appendix A and
Appendix B, towards the end of this document, list the available mirrors for
GSB and Slackware/Slackware64 respectivly.  Please check those mirror lists now
and select a mirror for GSB and Slackware/Slackware64 which will be added to
the slapt-getrc file here.

To create the slapt-getrc for GSB, open a text editor (we recommend 'nano'):
  $ nano /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb

Add the following lines exactly as shown (copy and paste is your friend):
  WORKINGDIR=/var/slapt-get
  EXCLUDE=^kernel-.*,^glibc.*,.*-[0-9]+dl$,^devs$,^udev$,aaa_elflibs

In addition to the above, you will need to add two SOURCE= lines to the file -
one SOURCE for GSB and one SOURCE for Slackware/Slackware64:
  SOURCE=<your chosen GSB mirror URL from Appendix A>
  SOURCE=<your chosen Slackware/Slackware64 mirror URL from Appendix B>

Once all 4 of the above lines have been added to the file, save it and exit the
text editor.  Configuration of slapt-get is now complete.

You will now need to update the slapt-get cache files:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb --update

If the above update process ran without errors, you are now ready to begin
installation by selecting which of the GSB software 'sets' you would like to
install.

Appendix C, towards the end of this document, details the available 'sets' of
packages which can be installed.  We highly recommend installation of the
'gsb-complete' set unless you are sure you know what you are doing.

Once you have selected the set to be installed you can begin the install
process with:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --upgrade
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 \
      --install <your chosen package set from Appendix C>
  (Note: the second command has been spanned over two lines for readability)

For clarity, to install the 'gsb-complete' set (highly recommended) use the
following commands:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --upgrade
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --install gsb-complete

With any luck, the installation process will finish without any errors or
problems and GSB will now be installed on your system.  Please read the section
'After installation' (and the sections which follow it) below.


Installing from a local copy
----------------------------

Installing from a local copy of GSB and/or Slackware/Slackware64 is a very
similar process to the manual slapt-get net installation detailed above - it is
recommended that you read that section in addition to this one, in order to
understand the slapt-get installtion process.  Only brief instructions are
given here.

For the following instructions, </path/to/gsb> referrs to the local filesystem
location for the GSB mirror, and </path/to/slackware> referrs to the local
filesystem location to the Slackware/Slackware64 mirror.  Both of these should,
obviously, be replaced with the full correct paths to each mirror.  These paths
can also be on a CDROM or USB device if the mirrors are located on such media.

As with the manual slapt-get net installation, a GSB slapt-getrc file must be
created - however, the two SOURCE entries in the slapt-getrc for this install
method will be local filesystem paths, not URIs.

Create the slapt-getrc:
  $ nano /etc/slapt-getrc.gsb

Add the required configuration:
  WORKINGDIR=/var/slapt-get
  EXCLUDE=^kernel-.*,^glibc.*,.*-[0-9]+dl$,^devs$,^udev$,aaa_elflibs

Finally, add the two SOURCE entries:
  SOURCE=file://</path/to/gsb>
  SOURCE=file://</path/to/slackware>

Save the file and exit the text editor.  Use these commands to update the
slapt-get cache files:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb --update

Finally, as with the manual slapt-get net installation, you must choose which
'set' to install.  Details of the sets are in Appendix C below, but we highly
recommend that you install 'gsb-complete'.

To start the installation, use:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --upgrade
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 \
      --install <your chosen package set from Appendix C>
  (Note: the second command has been spanned over two lines for readability)

For clarity, to install the 'gsb-complete' set (highly recommended) use the
following commands:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --upgrade
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --install gsb-complete

With any luck, the installation process will finish without any errors or
problems and GSB will now be installed on your system.  Please read the section
'After installation' (and the sections which follow it) below.


After installation
------------------

IMPORTANT! Fix your config files.  Some of the config files in /etc are going
to need your attention.  You'll find the new incoming config files on your
system with the ".new" extension.  You may need to fill these in with
information from your old config files and then move them over.

It is highly recommended that you reboot your system after installation in
order to insure that all services/daemons required by GNOME have been started.
You can start the daemons manually and avoid the need to reboot, but there are
a number of services that need to be started.  It may be easier to reboot;
otherwise, to must reload udev and message bus.

  $ /etc/rc.d/rc.udev reload
  $ /etc/rc.d/rc.messagebus reload

Depending on your packages installed, you may also want:
  
  $ /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon start
  $ /etc/rc.d/rc.networkmanager start

If your system is configured to start at run level 4 (the X11 graphical login),
your usual display manager should now have been replaced with GDM - the GNOME
Display Manager.  You should be able to log in with your usual username and
password in the same way as you did before - but be sure to check that GNOME
(or Compiz GNOME if you want fancy 3D stuffs) is selected in the Sessions list.

If you usually log into your system at run level 3 (text based login) and then
use 'startx' or similar you should log in as your usual (not root!) user and
run:
  $ xwmconfig

and select the GNOME (or Compiz GNOME) option from the menu.

You can also repeat the above as root to set the default for the whole system,
but using root as your every day login user is a *really* *stupid* *idea*.

You can then use 'startx' to start GSB as usual.

If you have any problems starting GSB or logging in, please see below for
support links and mailing lists.


Uninstalling GNOME SlackBuild
-----------------------------

You will need to remove all GNOME SlackBuild packages, and then re-install any
Slackware/Slackware64 provided packages that may have been replaced by GSB.

To remove all the GSB packages, run (as root):
  $ removepkg $(ls /var/log/packages/*gsb | grep -v slapt-get) | tee /tmp/gsb-uninstall.log

This will remove all GNOMESlackBuild packages and leave slapt-get still
installed to help reinstalling any required Slackware packages again.

You should probably check the uninstall log at /tmp/gsb-uninstall.log to see if
any files installed by GSB packages got left behind - it's up to you how much
housekeeping you want to do on those files. :)

Once all the GSB packages are removed and you've done any housekeeping, you
will need to re-install any Slackware/Slackware64 packages which were replaced
by the GSB provided ones.  A complete list of standard Slackware/Slackware64
packages GSB replaced during installation can be found in our
SLACKWARE-13.1_REPLACED_PACKAGES.TXT.

If you are using slapt-get to re-install the packages, you will need to comment
out any SOURCE= line(s) for GSB in your /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc file (if any
were added during installation).  Then be sure to run:
  $ slapt-get --update

Once that is finished, you can re-install the standard Slackware packages by
running:
  $ slapt-get --install <list of packages>

where the <list of packages> is those obtained from the replaced packages list.

If you don't use slapt-get to maintain your Slackware/Slackware64 packages, you
can use 'installpkg' (or whatever your preferred package management front-end
is) to simply re-install any required packages.

It would also be a good idea to select an alternative window manager (as
detailed in the 'After installation' section), and reboot your system to insure
all GSB daemon/services have been stopped.


Questions, Comments and Support
-------------------------------

Do one of the following (in this order):
  * Check the FAQs and other helpfull resources on the website:
      <http://gnomeslackbuild.org/support/>

  * For bug reports and feature requests, please check our issue tracker for
    previous reports of the same problem and possible solutions.  If your bug
    or feature is not solved or listed, add it:
      <http://dev.gnomeslackbuild.org/>

  * Join the GSB User Discussion Mailing List:
      <http://gnomeslackbuild.org/lists/>

    Firstly, check the archive to see if anyone else has had a similar problem
    which has already been solved.  You will not get any points for requesting
    help with a problem that has already been addressed.

    The mailing list is the easiest and preferred method of contact for support
    type issues - it allows us to keep an archive of questions and answers.

    Note: You must be subscribed to the mailing list in order to post messages.

  * Join the #gsb IRC channel on irc.freenode.net and ask questions - without
    whinging, bitching, repeatidly asking the same question, repeatidly asking
    'is anyone here?' or being a general idiot.  We are a friendly bunch
    (well, mostly anyway) and willing to help IF YOU GIVE US RESPECT.

    On IRC, we may appear to be always online, but we are frequently away from
    the console and you may not receive an answer for a while.  But stick
    around since we'll try to give a reply, eventually  :)


Appendix A - GSB repositories/mirrors
-------------------------------------

The following is a list of mirrors from which to download GSB.  Any of the
mirrors can be used in slapt-get and each is synced with the master server at
least once per day.

For the IA32 (i586, i686 et al) version of GSB for Slackware 13.1:
  <ftp://ftp.slackware.org.uk/gsb/gsb-current/>
  <http://www.slackware.org.uk/gsb/gsb-current/>
  <ftp://ftp.slackware.pl/pub/gnomeslackbuild/gsb/gsb-current/>
  <http://slackware.rol.ru/gsb/gsb/gsb-current/>
  <http://get.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/gsb-current/>

For the x86_64 (opteron, athlon64, et al) version of GSB for Slackware64 13.1:
  <ftp://ftp.slackware.org.uk/gsb/gsb64-current/>

  <http://get.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/gsb64-current/>

Appendix B - Slackware/Slackware64 repositories/mirrors
--------------------------------------------------------

The follwoing is a non-exhaustive list of Slackware/Slackware64 mirrors which
can be used to resolve dependancies during the GSB installation.  These mirrors
have been manually checked to insure they are alive and up to date, but we
cannot guarantee how often they update or how long they will be available.  You
can, of course, use your own favourite Slackware/Slackware64 mirror instead.

Appendix C - gsb-desktop meta packages and sets
------------------------------------------------

GSB has been divided into package sets which can be selectivly installed to
suit the need of the user.  We offer a "metapackage" of gsb-desktop to easy
installations via slapt-get (so you don't need to enter every package by hand)

  * gsb-desktop
      This is the basic, yet fully functional GNOME Desktop Environment
      provided by GSB.  It contains all the packages required for a working
      GNOME Desktop, including Epiphany, Evolution, the GNOME Display Manager
      (GDM), NetworkManager, Gslapt for package management and some basic 
      themes and desktop utilities.
