		 HOW TO INSTALL GSB: GNOME SlackBuild 2.24.0
                    =======================================

GNOME SlackBuild (GSB) has two components; a full and complete system to build
Slackware compliant packages from GNOME sources, and a binary distribution of
those pre-built packages, suitable for Slackware and Slamd64.

This document provides information on installing our pre-built GSB packages on
Slackware and Slamd64.  GSB encompasses all needed packages for a fully
configurable, customisable and usable GNOME desktop environment.

If you haven't yet, you should read about the GSB project before installing:
  <http://gnomeslackbuild.org/>

This version of GSB is built and only supported on:
  Slackware 12.1
  Slamd64 12.1

If you are trying to use GSB on systems other than the above you *will*
encounter problems.  If you are running a previous version of Slackware or
Slamd64, you must upgrade.  Do not attempt to install this version of GSB on
previous versions of Slackware and Slamd64.


Installation methods
--------------------

Before starting an installation, please, PLEASE, *P L E A S E* read this entire
document.  There is important information about performing the installation,
and post-installation configuration and problems that may occur.  If you do not
read this entire document and have a problem which is covered here you WILL NOT
make any friends on the mailing lists or IRC channel and we will likely not
bother to help you, in the same way as you have not bothered to help yourself.

GSB currently supports three installation methos; a fully automated net based
installer, installation over the net using a manually configured slapt-get, and
installation from a local repository mirror.

The automated net installer, obviously, requires an active internet connection
to perform the installation - packages are downloaded from one of the GSB
mirror sites (randomly selected from our mirrors list) and installed onto the
system automatically.  However, with the net installer there is no facility to
select what packages will be installed - the net installer will install all
packages listed in the 'gsb-complete' meta package (see below).  This is by
far the best option for users who want a fully functional, fully featured
GNOME desktop.

The second net based install requires manual configuation of slapt-get with the
GSB repository details.  slapt-get will also need to be configured with a
Slackware/Slamd64 mirror so that it can resolve any dependancies the GSB
packages may have on Slackware/Slamd64 packages.  Once slapt-get is configured,
any of the GSB meta packages (see below) or individual packages can be
installed - this allows fine grained package selection or installation of
different collections of packages without having to download a full copy of
our repository.

If net installation is not possible or there are many installations to be
performed, GSB can be installed from a local mirror/repository.  This procedure
requires a full local copy of the whole GSB binary tree - either on hard disk,
a CDROM or some other portable media, and follows the same general process as
the manual slapt-get net installation, except that slapt-get is configured
to use a local GSB repository rather than a online one.

Each of the procedures for installation is detailed below.  Once you have
decided which option is best for you, please refer to the appropriate section
for full instructions.

If you regulaly use slapt-get to keep your packages up to date, or have
multiple repositories in your slapt-getrc, it is important that you read the
section titled 'Problems when using slapt-get' below.


Before installation
-------------------

The installation is best done at runlevel 3 - *without* X11 running.  It is not
advisable to do the installation from within an XTerm or Terminal Emulator.

If you have any X11 sessions open which were started with the 'startx' command
(or similar) after you logged into the console in text mode, you must exit
those sessions to insure the installation goes smoothly.  Once those are closed
you will probably be returned to your normal (unprivilged) user account shell
prompt, you should now logout using:
  $ logout

You should now be back at the text based 'login:' prompt.  Skip the next 2
paragraphs nad continue with the procedure.

If your system boots (or has been put) into runlevel 4 (the graphical login
runlevel), you must put the system back into runlevel 3.  Firstly, if you are
in X11, you need to get to a text login console - hold down the Ctl and Alt
keys and press F6.  This will take you to a text based 'login:' prompt, where
you should log in as 'root' using your root password.  Once logged in, use this
command to bring the system back to runlevel 3:
  $ init 3

Wait for the process to finish (it might help to hit Enter a couple of times
after 20-30 seconds).  During the process, your active terminal may be changed,
so you may not be returned to the shell prompt.  If the active terminal has
changed, it will probably now show another 'login:' prompt.  If you are
returned to the shell prompt after hitting Enter a couple of times, you do not
need to log out (and can skip the rest of this section) - you are logged in
as 'root' and can begin installation.

In either of the two cases above, if you have a text based 'login:' prompt on
screen, you must login as 'root' using your own root password.

You should now be logged into your system as the 'root' user, your system
should be at runlevel 3, and there should be no active X11 sessions.


Automated net installation
--------------------------

This is the simplest method of installation and requires very little detailed
explanation - you simply run one command and a full installation of GSB, plus
any of the required Slackware/Slamd64 package dependancies, will be installed.

Depending on whether you have 'wget', 'curl' or 'lynx' available on your system,
you can use one of the following commands to begin installation.
Be sure to use the correct URI for your architecture - GSB supports both IA32
(32 bit Slackware) and x86_64 (64 bit Slamd64).

Using wget:
  For IA32:
    $ wget -q -O- http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install | bash
  For x86_64:
    $ wget -q -O- http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install/64 | bash

Using curl:
  For IA32:
    $ curl http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install | bash
  For x86_64:
    $ curl http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install/64 | bash

Using lynx:
  For IA32:
    $ lynx --source http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install | bash
  For x86_64:
    $ lynx --source http://gnomeslackbuild.org/net-install/64 | bash


Manual slapt-get net installation
---------------------------------

The first thing to do for a manual slapt-get installation is to download and
install slapt-get.  slapt-get requires the curl, glibc-solibs, gpgme,
libgpg-error, libidn and openssl-solibs packages from Slackware/Slamd64, which
must be installed from a mirror before slapt-get can be used for installation.

If you already have slapt-get (and the required dependancies) installed on your
system there is no reason to replace that version with ours before installation,
but during the GSB installation process it will be automatically updated to our
provided version.

Download slapt-get for Slackware 12.1 from:
  <http://get.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/gsb-stable/packages/tools/>

Download slapt-get for Slamd64 12.1 from:
  <http://get.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/gsb64-stable/packages/tools/>

And use the following command to install:
  $ upgradepkg --install-new slapt-get-*.tgz

Once slapt-get is installed, a basic configuration file must be created for the
installation.  We do not recommend editing your current slapt-get configuration
unless you know what you are doing.  These instructions will create a new, GSB
specific, slapt-getrc file which should be used just for installation and for
future updates.

Before the slapt-getrc file can be created, you must select the GSB and
Slackware/Slamd64 mirrors to be used for the installation.  Appendix A and
Appendix B, towards the end of this document, list the available mirrors
for GSB and Slackware/Slamd64 respectivly.  Please check those mirror lists now
and select a mirror for GSB and Slackware/Slamd64 which will be added to the
slapt-getrc file here.

To create the slapt-getrc for GSB, open a text editor (we recommend 'nano'):
  $ nano /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb

Add the following lines exactly as shown (copy and paste is your friend):
  WORKINGDIR=/var/slapt-get
  EXCLUDE=^kernel-.*,^glibc.*,.*-[0-9]+dl$,^devs$,^udev$,aaa_elflibs

In addition to the above, you will need to add two SOURCE= lines to the file -
one SOURCE for GSB and one SOURCE for Slackware/Slamd64:
  SOURCE=<your chosen GSB mirror URL from Appendix A>
  SOURCE=<your chosen Slackware/Slamd64 mirror URL from Appendix B>

Once all 4 of the above lines have been added to the file, save it and exit the
text editor.  Configuration of slapt-get is now complete.

You will now need to update the slapt-get cache files:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb --update

If the above update process ran without errors, you are now ready to begin
installation by selecting which of the GSB software 'sets' you would like to
install.

Appendix C, towards the end of this document, details the available 'sets' of
packages which can be installed.  We highly recommend installation of the
'gsb-complete' set unless you are sure you know what you are doing.

Once you have selected the set to be installed you can begin the install
process with:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --upgrade
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 \
      --install <your chosen package set from Appendix C>
  (Note: the second command has been spanned over two lines for readability)

For clarity, to install the 'gsb-complete' set (highly recommended) use the
following commands:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --upgrade
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --install gsb-complete

With any luck, the installation process will finish without any errors or
problems and GSB will now be installed on your system.  Please read the section
'After installation' (and the sections which follow it) below.


Installing from a local copy
----------------------------

Installing from a local copy of GSB and/or Slackware/Slamd64 is a very similar
process to the manual slapt-get net installation detailed above - it is
recommended that you read that section in addition to this one, in order to
understand the slapt-get installtion process.  Only brief instructions are
given here.

For the following instructions, </path/to/gsb> referrs to the local filesystem
location for the GSB mirror, and </path/to/slackware> referrs to the local
filesystem location to the Slackware/Slamd64 mirror.  Both of these should,
obviously, be replaced with the full correct paths to each mirror.  These
paths can also be on a CDROM or USB device if the mirrors are located on such
media.

As with the manual slapt-get net installation, a GSB slapt-getrc file must be
created - however, the two SOURCE entries in the slapt-getrc for this install
method will be local filesystem paths, not URIs.

Create the slapt-getrc:
  $ nano /etc/slapt-getrc.gsb

Add the required configuration:
  WORKINGDIR=/var/slapt-get
  EXCLUDE=^kernel-.*,^glibc.*,.*-[0-9]+dl$,^devs$,^udev$,aaa_elflibs

Finally, add the two SOURCE entries:
  SOURCE=file://</path/to/gsb>
  SOURCE=file://</path/to/slackware>

Save the file and exit the text editor.  Use these commands to update the
slapt-get cache files:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb --update

Finally, as with the manual slapt-get net installation, you must choose which
'set' to install.  Details of the sets are in Appendix C below, but we highly
recommend that you install 'gsb-complete'.

To start the installation, use:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --upgrade
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 \
      --install <your chosen package set from Appendix C>
  (Note: the second command has been spanned over two lines for readability)

For clarity, to install the 'gsb-complete' set (highly recommended) use the
following commands:
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --upgrade
  $ slapt-get -c /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc.gsb -y --retry 10 --install gsb-complete

With any luck, the installation process will finish without any errors or
problems and GSB will now be installed on your system.  Please read the section
'After installation' (and the sections which follow it) below.


After installation
------------------

It is highly recommended that you reboot your system after installation in
order to insure that all services/daemons required by GNOME have been started.
You can start the daemons manually and avoid the need to reboot, but there are
a number of services that need to be started - it's just easier to reboot!

If your system is configured to start at run level 4 (the X11 graphical login),
your usual display manager should now have been replaced with GDM - the GNOME
Display Manager.  You should be able to log in with your usual username and
password in the same way as you did before - but be sure to check that GNOME
(or Compiz GNOME if you want fancy 3D stuffs) is selected in the Sessions list.

If you usually log into your system at run level 3 (text based login) and then
use 'startx' or similar you should log in as your usual (not root!) user and
run:
  $ xwmconfig

and select the GNOME (or Compiz GNOME) option from the menu.

You can also repeat the above as root to set the default for the whole system,
but using root as your every day login user is a *really* *stupid* *idea*.

You can then use 'startx' to start GSB as usual.

If you have any problems starting GSB or logging in, please see below for
support links and mailing lists.


Uninstalling GNOME SlackBuild
-----------------------------

Firstly, why do you want to?
Seriously, I mean, what are your alternatives?
KDE?  No thanks, might as well use Windows.
Dropline GNOME?  I'd rather not have PAM bastardising my system, thanks :)
So, really, don't uninstall GSB :)

So you still want to?  You will need to remove all GNOME SlackBuild packages,
and then re-install any Slackware/Slamd64 provided packages that may have been
replaced by GSB ones.

To remove all the GSB packages, run (as root):
  $ removepkg /var/log/packages/*gsb | tee /tmp/gsb-uninstall.log

You should probably check the uninstall log at /tmp/gsb-uninstall.log to see if
any files installed by GSB packages got left behind - it's up to you how much
housekeeping you want to do on those files :)

Once all the GSB packages are removed and you've done any housekeeping, you
will need to re-install any Slackware/Slamd64 packages which were replaced by
the GSB provided ones.  A complete list of standard Slackware/Slamd64 packages
GSB replaced during installation can be found here:
  <http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/trunk/notes/replaced_packages_gsb-2.22>

From the above list of packages, re-install any which may be required for your
system to operate correctly.

If you are using slapt-get to re-install the packages, you will need to comment
out any SOURCE= line(s) for GSB in your /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc file (if any
were added during installation).  Then be sure to run:
  $ slapt-get --update

Once that is finished, you can re-install the standard Slackware packages by
running:
  $ slapt-get --install <list of packages>

where the <list of packages> is those obtained from the replaced packages list.

If you don't use slapt-get to maintain your Slackware/Slamd64 packages, you can
use 'installpkg' (or whatever your preferred package management front-end is)
to simply re-install any required packages.

It would also be a good idea to select an alternative window manager (as
detailed in the 'After installation' section), and reboot your system to insure
all GSB daemon/services have been stopped.


Questions, Comments and Support
-------------------------------

Do one of the following (in this order):
  * Check the FAQs and other helpfull resources on the website:
      <http://gnomeslackbuild.org/support/>

  * For bug reports and feature requests, please check our issue tracker for
    previous reports of the same problem and possible solutions.  If your bug
    or feature is not solved or listed, add it:
      <http://dev.gnomeslackbuild.org/>

  * Join the GSB User Discussion Mailing List:
      <http://gnomeslackbuild.org/lists/>

    Firstly, check the archive to see if anyone else has had a similar problem
    which has already been solved.  You will not get any points for requesting
    help with a problem that has already been addressed.

    The mailing list is the easiest and preferred method of contact for support
    type issues - it allows us to keep an archive of questions and answers.

    Note: You must be subscribed to the mailing list in order to post messages.

  * Join the #gsb IRC channel on irc.freenode.net and ask questions - without
    whinging, bitching, repeatidly asking the same question, repeatidly asking
    'is anyone here?' or being a general idiot.  We are a friendly bunch
    (well, mostly anyway) and willing to help IF YOU GIVE US RESPECT.

    On IRC, we may appear to be always online, but we are frequently away from
    the console and you may not receive an answer for a while.  But stick
    around since we'll try to give a reply, eventually  :)


Appendix A - GSB repositories/mirrors
-------------------------------------

The following is a list of mirrors from which to download GSB.  Any of the
mirrors can be used in slapt-get and each is synced with the master server at
least once per day.

For the IA32 (i586, i686 et al) version of GSB for Slackware 12.1:
  <ftp://ftp.slackware.org.uk/gsb/gsb-2.22/>
  <http://www.slackware.org.uk/gsb/gsb-2.22/>
  <ftp://ftp.slackware.pl/pub/gnomeslackbuild/gsb/gsb-2.22/>

Appendix B - Slackware/Slamd64 repositories/mirrors
---------------------------------------------------

The follwoing is a non-exhaustive list of Slackware/Slamd64 mirrors which can
be used to resolve dependancies during the GSB installation.  These mirrors
have been manually checked to insure they are alive and up to date, but we
cannot guarantee how often they update or how long they will be available.
You can, of course, use your own favourite Slackware/Slamd64 mirror instead.

Appendix C - Meta packages and sets
-----------------------------------

GSB has been divided into package sets which can be selectivly installed to
suit the need of the user.  The packages which will be installed by each set
are listed in meta packages which slapt-get knows how to process and install.

The following meta packages (or sets) can be used with slapt-get once it has
been configured with a GSB repository - a detailed description of each set is
also provided:
  * gsb-complete
      This set includes the entire GSB distribution - every package.  It
      contains all the multimedia, development, office, desktop, compiz,
      library and accessibility packages available from GSB.  It is a huge
      download and a huge install, but provides everything a user could want
      in a GNOME desktop.  It is *highly* recommended that a full installation
      be performed using this set.

  * gsb-desktop
      This is the basic, yet fully functional GNOME Desktop Environment
      provided by GSB.  It contains all the packages required for a working
      GNOME Desktop, including Epiphany, Evolution, the GNOME Display Manager
      (GDM), NetworkManager, Gslapt for package management and some basic 
      themes and desktop utilities.

  * gsb-basic
      This set provides only the basic base libraries for using GNOME
      applications, including libgnome, libgnomeui, and libgnomecanvas, and all
      dependencies.

  * gsb-accessibility
      This set is for all the accessibility applications and utilities for the
      GNOME Desktop, such as Orca and GNOME Magnifier.

  * gsb-administration
      This set is all the administration applications and utilities for the
      the GNOME Desktop, such as Pessulus and Sabayon.

  * gsb-multimedia
      The full multimedia suite for GNOME SlackBuild.  It includes various
      music players, like Banshee, Rhythmbox, Totem, as well as MPlayer, and a
      full assortment of codec libraries.

  * gsb-office
      This is a full Office Suite, with software for all aspects of the office,
      like Glom for database, Goffice, Gnumeric, Abiword, as well as Dia for a
      Visio-like charting program and of course, Open Office.

  * gsb-ooo
      This set is for easy installation of our OpenOffice.Org build for GSB.
      Openoffice is linked against Gtk+2 to fit well with the GNOME Desktop,
      and comes with a set of menus for better GNOME integration.

  * gsb-development
      This set contains a full Development Environment, including packages such
      such as Anjuta, Glade3, and C++ bindings for most GNOME packages.

  * gsb-themes
      This set provides a few extra themes for GSB, as well as a few of the
      more popular GTK engines in use by a wide variety of GNOME themes.

  * gsb-compiz
      This set installs the 3D window manager: Compiz.  Its configuration
      utilities as well as Compiz GNOME Integration.

  * gsb-mono
      This set provides the Mono/C# development tools, including a working
      Mono C# compiler, GNOME bindings, and a MonoDevelop IDE.
