applications/gdm-2.20.6-i586-1gsb.tgz: Upgraded.
  A lot of crash conditions fixed is this release.  Upgrade recommended.

  more information.

  Development on GSB-CURRENT begins.  :^)
testing/banshee-1-0.99.1-i586-1gsb.tgz: Added.
  This is the new Beta release of the Banshee rewriter.  Things
  are starting to look really good!  Here is the preview. 
administration/pm-utils-1.1.0-i586-1gsb.tgz: Added.
  Users may need this package in order to use gnome-power-manager
  to hibernate/suspend their machines.  g-p-m uses hal for all power
  events, and hal in turn uses pm-utils.  Caveat emptor.

  Added pm-utils to slack-required.
office/glom-1.6.17-i586-1gsb.tgz: Upgraded.

  Minor tweaks I suppose always follow a brand new stable release.
  No binary package changes.

  Thanks to John Garrott for pointing out that the gsb-complete
  metapackage wasn't so complete.  Added in the missing packages. :^)
libraries/XML-Simple-2.18-i586-3gsb.tgz: Removed.
  Deprecated.  Not a part of any installation, and replaced by 
  Slackware's perl.  Should have been removed from the tree earlier 
  but I missed this one.  :/
