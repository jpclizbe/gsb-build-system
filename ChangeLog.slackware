GNOME SlackBuild 2.30 for x86 stable is released!
Things are very stable.  A lot of weight has been trimmed in this release of
GSB, and we now only needs to replace two Slackware packages.  The desktop is
solid, responsive and polished and comes with a full set of great GNOME
applications.  Please make sure to read CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT to see what has
changed in this release, and for a few potential gotchas.  The next set of
GNOME maintenance patches will be out in a few weeks.  For now, enjoy!
