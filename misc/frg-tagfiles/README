These tagfiles can be used to install Slackware 10.1 for use with FRG.

There should be no outstanding dependancy issues after doing an install of
Slackware 10.1 from these tagfiles (plus appropriate updates from the
patches/ directory) and a minimal or full install of Freerock's GNOME.

I've included packages such as pppd (and rp-pppoe), dhcpcd and iptables to
make it easy to get connected to the 'net.  I have also included packages
such as bind, traceroute, whois, etc as these are used by the Networking
Tools GNOME applet.

Also included is gimp-print, hpijs and cups to allow easy setup of
printers.  SANE and XSANE are also included for scanning facilities and
tools to allow burning of DVD/CD's.

If you find any *standard* Slackware 10.1 packages are required in
addition to the ones installed by these tagfiles, please let me know so I
can update.

Please let me know if you find any errors or omissions or think a package
should be included/excluded from the tagfiles.

Enjoy :)
