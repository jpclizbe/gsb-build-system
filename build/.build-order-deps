When running through the build, it will stop because a dep
needs to be built resides in another set, then the whole
loop startes again.  Fucking annoying.  In the spirit of
addressing that, I'm doc'ing those deps here.
----------------------------------------------------------

Pre-Build Run:
--------------
*  Build system requires the following packages to run
   initially:

	qt3 (extras/kde3-compat)
	jdk (extras/jdk)

Build Run:
----------
*  perhaps slapt-get shoule be installed and then
   --update'd by our build   system early on?
   When running build, poppler failed because build system
   looks for package deps (qt in this case) then fires up
   slapt-get.  Fails obviously since slapt-get isn't present.
