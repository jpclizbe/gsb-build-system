				SVN Branches
				============

We currently maintain several SVN branches to produce our GSB releases.  The
following is a list of our trees and the URIs which should be used to 'svn co'
them.

Bleeding edge 'gsb-current' tree:
  http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/branches/gsb-testing_slack13

  This tree contains the latest and most up to date GSB sources.  As such, at
any time it may be broken (ie, will not build fully).  This tree is usually
only for the latest Slackware or Slackware64 and may not work on other
releases.

For additional branches:

  http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/branches/gsb-2.26
  http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/branches/gsb-2.24
  http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/branches/gsb-2.22
