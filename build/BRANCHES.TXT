GNOME SlackBuild GIT Branches
==============================

We currently maintain several code branches to produce our GSB releases.  The
following is a list of our trees and the URIs which should be used.

Bleeding edge and main development tree is "master":

	<http://github.com/gnomeslackbuild/gsb-build-system>

You can check it out with:

  $ git clone git://github.com/gnomeslackbuild/gsb-build-system

You can view the different branches by using:

  $ git branch -r

  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  origin/gsb-3.0-devel
  origin/master

And then you can switch to your desired version of GSB by using:
 
  $ git checkout <branch-name>
  $ git pull  (Just to ensure you have the latest)

The master tree contains the latest and most up to date GSB sources.  As such,
at any time it may be broken (i.e., will not build fully), however we try our
best to ensure that it's always working.  If you want a stable version, stick
to a branch that has been versioned (i.e., the gsb-2.x branches) 

The 'master' branch is deemed to be cutting edge and is designed with the
latest Slackware or Slackware64 in mind and may not work on other or earlier
releases.
