These are packages I cannot, for whatever reason, build on a
Slackware -current machine.  Any help here would be appreciated.
----------------------------------------------------------------

*  gnome-scan: genric compile error
*  gst-plugins-bad (mpeg4ip and faac):  mpeg4ip fails on compile.
   This code is abandoned, hence the bad" label :-/  faac depends
   on it, though.
*  abiword: (complains that it can't find '-lboost_system-mt')
   Perhaps the newer version pf boost would help?  Dunno.  There
   is a bootst_asio patch included, but I'm not sure if that's
   not working, etc.
