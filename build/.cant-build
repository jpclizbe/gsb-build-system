These are packages I cannot, for whatever reason, build on a
Slackware -current machine.  Any help here would be appreciated.

32bt:

*  gnome-scan: generic compile error - disabled in src/go/.buildlist
*  gst-plugins-bad (mpeg4ip and faac):  mpeg4ip fails on compile.
   This code is abandoned, hence the bad" label :-/  faac depends
   on it, though.  Tons of MM apps then depend on faac.
   Temp workaraound is to disable mpeg4ip and faac :-/
*  mjpegtools: generic compile error

64bit:

*  MPlayer: compile error
