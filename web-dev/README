How to update content on this website
-------------------------------------

1) Intro:

There are essentially only two things that change on this site:

  * Version numbers
  * News and announcements

Facilities have been implemented to update the aforementioned
items quite easily...

---

2) Version Numbers:

Version numbers are referenced in many sections/places within the site.  But
they only need to be changed in one file...

	web/versions.txt

The legend for the version numbers is explained in the header of that file.

To reference version mumbers in the site templates "web/content/foo.html":

    <?php echo $gsb_bin_stable_ver; ?>
      References the GSB actual stable binary release (tracks GNOME ver.)
      
    <?php echo $gsb_source_ver; ?>
      References the GSB source release.
      
    ...and so on (see web/common/versions_inc.php for all variables)

---

3) News and Announcements:

News is displayed on the site in reverse-chronological order (newest entry
first).  It's very simple to edit/add news; by editing one small file:

	web/news.txt

The file is a specially-formatted text file, and is parsed by some PHP
functions to display nice and cleanly on the site.

The format of the news.txt file is as follows:

	###
	date
	Title of news entry
	Body of news entry

The "###" text, is actually a separator, so that the PHP news function knows to
parse that as one entire "article".  The body section of the news entry accepts
HTML, but that is the only place HTML is used.  URI's are automatically made as
links.  To reference an internal URI, one must use the following format:

	<a href="/foo/">See the foo section</a>

Hint:  Internal URIs /never/ use "http://" - ever.  Reference them to the
base/root of the site, as shown in the above example.

Just open the web/news.txt file for live examples. Or, point a browser to:
<http://gnomeslackbuild.org/news.txt> - which is the actual, raw news file used
on the website.

3a) News Article Style Guide:

It is important to note, that news areticles are  automatically enclosed within
HTML block-level elements.  HOWEVER, do not wrap the very first paragraph of a
news article in any block-level elements...ever.  For subsequent paargraphs
(after the 1st), you must enclose the paragraph in block-level elements
(mainly, "<p>").  If a news article is only one short blurb/paragraph, don't
enclose it in anything at all.  The site engine will handle it all for you.
