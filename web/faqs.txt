My KDE Menus are all messed up after installing FRG/GSB! How do I fix them?
<p>The KDE menus might be changed if you install FRG because of the
gnome-menus package, The gnome-menus package implements the freedesktop.org
desktop menu specification. There is a simple fix for this. Just add the
following near the top of the startkde script:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 <code><strong>export XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/opt/kde/etc/xdg</strong></code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>If the improper menus persist, run kbuildsycoca from Konsole after you have
logged into KDE. Thanks to Jim Philips and Locustfurnace for pointing 
it out.</p>

Does GSB/FRG require the Linux 2.6 kernel?
No. GSB/FRG does not require the 2.6 kernel. However, to take advantage
of GNOME Volume Manager, the 2.6 kernel is needed.
