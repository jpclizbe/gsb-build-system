FRG-0.1.95 Released
<p>
  This is the second release of FRG with GNOME-2.10.0. It fixes the issues
  that were found in the next news item. This is still a beta release, so
  that any bugs can be found and fixed  before calling it a stable release.
</p>

<p>
  There are two bugs that still exist. In the gdm Actions menu, the Power Off
  option is not there. The reboot and configure options are still there.
  In the Logout dialogue the Power Off option is also not available. These 2
  things were working properly with the GNOME 2.9.91 FRG packages. This issue
  is most likely related to the gdm and gnome-session packages. We are trying
  to figure out the problems, any help with these issues would be greatly
  appreciated.
</p>

<p>
  As a result of this we have downgraded the gdm package from gdm-2.6.0.8 to
  gdm-2.6.0.7. This fixes the issue with the Power Off option in gdm's Actions
  menu. If you would like to try and fix the gdm issue, the gdm-2.6.0.8
  package is in the testing directory in the iso.
</p>

<p>
  If you were using frg-0.1.94 and want to upgrade to frg-0.1.95, then all you
  need to do is run the following rsync command and upgradepkg the packages in
  the downloaded directory:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
 <code><strong>
rsync -aPv rsync://freerock.dyndns.org/pub/frg-updates/frg-0.1.94 /tmp
</strong></code>
</p></blockquote>

Updates on FRG-0.1.94 release

<p><strong>UPDATE MARCH 13:</strong> Some more bugs have been found, some have been
fixed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    if you are using min_install.sh to install FRG, install the 
    desktop-file-utils-0.10-i486-1frg.tgz package in the other/ directory in
    the iso. It is needed for correct mime-type operation. After you install
    this package, as root, run.
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>
  <code><strong>
    /usr/bin/update-desktop-database
  </strong></code>
</p></blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    GDM and the logout dialogue in the Desktop menu do not show the power off
    option. They do show the reboot option though. This was working properly 
    with GNOME-2.9.91 release. I'm currently looking as to what changed in 
    the gdm and gnome-session packages to try and fix it.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>END UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>
  Thank you to everyone who provided feedback on the release. We have found
  and fixed a few bugs.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>xkbd issues. new libxklavier and control-center packages fix this</li>
  <li>New gstreamer and gst-plugins packages
  <ul>
    <li>
      gst-register does not get run when gstreamer and gst-plugins
      packages are installed
    </li>
    <li>
      libgstxine.so causes gst-register to seg fault. I 
      thought I had fixed the slackbuild to fix
      this as this issue popped up earlier. Its now fixed in SVN.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The gdm actions menu does not show the power off option anymore in version
    2.6.0.8. The reboot and configure options are still there. Anyone know
    what gives? gdm-2.6.0.7 package works fine, its available on the rsync
    server below.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To download the updated packages, run the following rsync command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
 <code><strong>
rsync -aPv rsync://freerock.dyndns.org/pub/frg-updates/frg-0.1.94 /tmp
</strong></code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
  That command will download the frg-updates directory to /tmp. Then just run upgradepkg
  on those packages.
</p>

<p>
  libnss.so is needed for the release. So for Slackware-10.1 users,  
  mozilla-1.7.5-i486-1 must be installed. If you are using 
  slackware-current you can do one of the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>install the slackware-10.1 mozilla package</li>
  <li>add /usr/lib/firefox to /etc/ld.so.conf</li>
  <li>
    symlink the libraries from /usr/lib/firefox into /usr/lib. The
    following should do that for you. It was taken from the mozilla.SlackBuild
    in the Slackware 10.1 source tree.
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>
 <code><strong>
 cd /usr/lib/firefox 
<br />for nsslib in libnspr4.so libnss3.so libplc4.so libplds4.so libsmime3.so libsoftokn3.so libssl3.so ; do
<br />    ln -sf $nsslib ../$nsslib
<br />done 
</strong></code>
</p></blockquote>

GSB Build Order Slightly Wrong
<p>While looking at the configure.in files to try and populate the slack-required files for slapt-get,
I noticed that the build order for GSB is wrong for some packages. I am currently fixing 
this in SVN. I am following the order more or less given by <strong>jhbuild list</strong> instead
of the documentation on gnome.org. This will not affect the build if you have previous versions
of some libs installed. Mainly glib2, gtk2, and libxml2</p>
<p> The order was wrong mainly for gstreamer, libcroco, and libgst. For the rest of the build, the order
was more or less right</p>

KDE Menus might get changed
<p>The KDE menus might be changed if you install FRG because of the gnome-menus
package, The gnome-menus package implements the freedesktop.org desktop menu spec.
There is a simple fix for this. Just add the following near the top of the
startkde script:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 <code><strong>export XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/opt/kde/etc/xdg</strong></code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>If the improper menus persist, run kbuildsycoca from Konsole after you have
logged into KDE. Thanks to Jim Philips and Locustfurnace for pointing 
it out.</p>

Freerock's GNOME version 0.0.2.2 Released
<p>It is available for download as an iso on the <a href="/downloads">download</a> page.
<br />
This release is a bug fix release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abiword and Gstreamer crashes were fixed, some bad plugins were at fault</li>
  <li>Howl is actually installed by the install script</li>
  <li>rc.hal fixed, there was a missing quotation mark on one of the lines.
    If you already have hal installed, please edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.howl script,
    and edit the line with echo "Starting Howl and add a " to the end</li>
  <li>added openldap and cyrus-sasl packages needed by evolution</li>
</ul>
<p>The next release will feature a sources iso, so that it will be easier for
users to take the iso and build a gnome release on their own. A user would
need to download the iso, mount it, then run GSB.SlackBuild and out will come
their slackware packages.</p>
