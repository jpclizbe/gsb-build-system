Freerock's GNOME version 0.0.2.2 Released
It is available for download as an iso on the download page.

This release is a bug fix release:
<ul>
  <li>Abiword and Gstreamer crashes were fixed, some bad plugins were at fault</li>
  <li>Howl is actually installed by the install script</li>
  <li>rc.hal fixed, there was a missing quotation mark on one of the lines.
    If you already have hal installed, please edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.howl script,
    and edit the line with echo "Starting Howl and add a " to the end</li>
  <li>added openldap and cyrus-sasl packages needed by evolution</li>
</ul>

The next release will feature a sources iso, so that it will be easier for
users to take the iso and build a gnome release on their own. A user would
need to download the iso, mount it, then run GSB.SlackBuild and out will come
their slackware packages.
