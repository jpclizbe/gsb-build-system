The GNOME Desktop
</h4>
GNOME 2.20 is the latest version of the GNOME Desktop. 

There have been a lot of improvements in GNOME 2.20, which include better desktop searching,
a more organized Evolution email and calendar client, enhanced image browsing,
simplified control panel, efficient power management, and powerful desktop tools, as well as 
a great new documentation web site.

For a complete summary of what is new to the GNOME 2.20 Desktop, please refer to the
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.20/notes/en/">release notes.</a> 

GNOME SlackBuild is designed to bring the greatest features of GNOME to Slackware, integrating
seamlessly into a standard install.  It uses the standard Slackware package system, and aims
to replace as few packages as possible.
