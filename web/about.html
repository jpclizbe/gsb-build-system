      GNOME <?php echo($frg_ver); ?> is the latest version of the
      GNOME Desktop. There have been a lot of improvements in GNOME <?php echo($frg_ver); ?>,
      which include better desktop searching, a more organized Evolution
      email and calendar client, enhanced image browsing, simplified
      control panel, efficient power management, and powerful desktop
      tools, as well as a great new documentation web site. For a
      complete summary of what is new to the GNOME <?php echo($frg_ver); ?>
      Desktop, please refer to the <a href=
      "http://www.gnome.org/start/<?php echo($frg_ver); ?>/notes/en/">release notes</a>.
      GNOME SlackBuild is designed to bring the greatest features of
      GNOME to Slackware, integrating seamlessly into a standard install.
      It uses the standard Slackware package system, and aims to replace
      as few packages as possible. For a list of packages that
      require updating, please see the <a href=

<h2 id="about-tech">Technical Info</h2>
  <p>
    GSB is comprised of two projects;
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>A complete GNOME distribution for Slackware
    Linux. Encompasses all needed packages for a complete, clean
    installation of GNOME for Slackware.  This is the core of the GSB project.</p></li>

    <li><p>The GSB source code (the actual Build System) - a collection of scripts that build
    a GNOME release on Slackware Linux. These scripts are used to build
    GSB.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>The goal of #2, is to run one script:
  <strong>GSB.SlackBuild</strong> and have it output Slackware
  packages for a GNOME release.<br />
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The latest (forthcoming) stable version of the GSB distro is <span class=
    "version"><?php echo($frg_ver); ?></span></li>

    <li>The current (forthcoming) version of the GSB source code is <span class=
    "version"><?php echo($gsb_ver); ?></span>.
    It builds GNOME <span class=
    "version"><?php echo($frg_ver); ?></span>
    (this is a beta version, if you are unsure wait until stable is
    released).</li>
  </ul>
