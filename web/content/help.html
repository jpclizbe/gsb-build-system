  <li>MIRRORS, I'd rather not rely on sourceforge to do package
  releases, for the isos, its fine. It is nice that they have a lot
  of mirrors to use, but the system they have is kind of annoying
  and I would like to organize package releases in their own
  directories, as they are on the iso. So if you can help with this,
  please speak up :)</li>
  
  <li>Fixing scripts, see Development Page</li>
  
  <li>Testers, Testers, Guinea Pigs, Testers</li>
  
  <li>Anything missing? Want something added?</li>
  
  <li>Some Graphics maybe? splash screen, background image, gdm screen ....</li>
  
  <li>Suggestions, advice, flames, money are all welcome
  :-)</li>
</ul>
