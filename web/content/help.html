<ul>
  <li>MIRRORS, I'd rather not rely on sourceforge to do package
  releases, for the isos, its fine. It is nice that they have a lot
  of mirrors to use, but the system they have is kind of annoying
  and I would like to organize package releases in their own
  directories, as they are on the iso. This will help with setting up
  slapt-get repositories. So if you can help with this,
  please speak up :)</li>
