<p>
  The best and prefered way to contact the developers is to email the 
  mailing lists.
  <br />
  We also idle on the irc channel, but are not always around to reply
  quickly. So if you ask a question wait for an answer, we will eventually
  get back to you :)
  <br />
  Send an email to me directly as a last resort.

    Lists</a> - you do not have to be subscribed to the mailing list. However the email will need to be moderated before it is sent to the list. You should also note in the email that people should cc their replies to you.
