  <p>The best and prefered way to contact the developers is to
  email the mailing lists. Before you ask questions, please check
  the <a href="/faqs/">FAQs</a>.<br />
  <br />
  We also idle on the irc channel, but are not always around to
  reply quickly. So if you ask a question wait for an answer, we
  will eventually get back to you :)<br />
  <br />
  Send an email to me directly as a last resort.</p>

      <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=130126">Mailing
      Lists</a> - you do not have to be subscribed to the mailing
      list. However the email will need to be moderated before it
      is sent to the list. You should also note in the email that
      people should cc their replies to you.
