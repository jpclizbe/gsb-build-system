    <h2 id="about">About GSB: GNOME.SlackBuild</h2>

    <p>
      GSB is comprised of two projects, GSB and FRG.
      <br /><small>Don't you think the world needs more acronyms? ;-)</small>
    </p>
      <ol>
      <li>
	GSB: GNOME.SlackBuild - a collection of scripts that build a GNOME
	release on Slackware Linux.
      </li>
      <li>
	FRG: Freerock GNOME - GNOME packages for Slackware linux, these
	packages are built using GSB.
      </li>
      </ol>

    <p>
      The goal of this project is to run one script:
      <strong>GSB.SlackBuild</strong> and have it output Slackware packages for
      a GNOME release.
      <br />
      <br />
      FRG is a secondary project built on top of GSB.
