<h1 id="todo">TODO</h1>

<p>In Order of Importance</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Write script to get source tarballs for each release and
    put them in appropriate directory and update respective
    SlackBuild's VERSION and BUILD variables (currently under way)
  </li>
  
  <li>Installer:
  <ul>
    <li>
      A custom installer, would like to have one, just don't want to
      write it.
    </li>

    <li>
      Installer should be able to check for updates for a release, and install
      it for the user.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
      Slapt-get compliance with slack-required files
  </li>
  <li>
    Scrollkeeper taking too long to update from doinst.sh scripts. Anyone
    know how to fix this?
  </li>
  
  <li>
    implement gnome.perl.bindings.SlackBuild
  </li>
  
  <li>
    add .desktop entries to packages that do not have them
  </li>
  
  <li>update some slackbuilds
  <ul>
    <li>
      NetworkManager - does not build with startup-notification-0.8,
      maybe try cvs build
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    check if anything is built into /usr/local and change it to /usr
  </li>

  <li>
    Figure out what to do with faac/faad and mpeg4ip. They seem to be
    redundant and might overlap with each other on libs. Faad does provide
    an xmms plugin for mp4/aac files.
  </li>
 
  <li>
    fix up slack-desc files, some of them have very sparse descriptions
  </li>
</ol>
