  <h2 id="help">What you can do to help</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Some easy things that need attention

      <ul>
        <li>fill up slack-required files</li>

        <li>Fix up slack-desc files</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>More thing to help with

      <ul>
        <li>MIRRORS, I'd rather not rely on sourceforge to do
        package releases, for the isos, its fine. It is nice that
        they have a lot of mirrors to use, but the system they have
        is kind of annoying and I would like to organize package
        releases in their own directories, as they are on the iso.
        This will help with setting up slapt-get repositories. So
        if you can help with this, please speak up :)</li>

  <h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>

  <p>In Order of Importance</p>

  <ol>
    <li>gsb_update.pl

      <ul>
        <li>GSB::Verify.pm - add md5 and gpg checking of src
        tarballs</li>

        <li>clean up repeatative areas of gsb_update.pl</li>

        <li>Fill up Themes.pm</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Figure out what to do with faac/faad and mpeg4ip. They seem
    to be redundant and might overlap with each other on libs. Faad
    does provide an xmms plugin for mp4/aac. mpeg4ip is needed by
    gtkpod.</li>

    <li>Installer:

      <ul>
        <li>I really don't want to deal with it, so if someone
        wants to help out with this, please speak up.</li>

        <li>malloc, of slapt-get fame, has donated a slapt-get
        installer based on the dropline installer. I haven't tested
        this yet or even looked at it. It is available in the SVN repo</li>

	<li>malloc has also started a GTK2 based graphical installer,
	its currently in development</li>

        <li>Installer should be able to check for updates for a
        release, and install it for the user.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Slapt-get compliance with slack-required files. Its
    partially done. Files are there for each package, they just
    need to be populated</li>

    <li>add update-mime-database and update-desktop-database to
    doinst.sh scripts that need them. See drivel's doinst.sh file
    for an example of how to implement this.</li>

    <li>Scrollkeeper taking too long to update from doinst.sh
    scripts. Anyone know how to fix this?</li>

    <li>add .desktop entries to any packages that do not have
    them</li>

    <li>update some slackbuilds

      <ul>
        <li>NetworkManager - does not build with
        startup-notification-0.8, maybe try cvs build</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>fix up slack-desc files, some of them have very sparse
    descriptions</li>
  </ol>
