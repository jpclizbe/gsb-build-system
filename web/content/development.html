<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>

<p>In Order of Importance</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    gsb_update.pl 
    <ul>
      <li>GSB::Verify.pm - add md5 and gpg checking of src tarballs</li>
      <li>clean up repeatative areas of gsb_update.pl</li>
      <li>Fill up Themes.pm</li>
    </ul>

    Figure out what to do with faac/faad and mpeg4ip. They seem to be
    redundant and might overlap with each other on libs. Faad does provide
    an xmms plugin for mp4/aac. mpeg4ip is needed by gtkpod.
  </li>
  
  <li>Installer: 

  <ul>
    <li>
      I really don't want to deal with it, so if someone wants to help out 
      with this, please speak up.  
    </li>

    <li>
      malloc, of slapt-get fame, has donated a slapt-get installer based on 
      the dropline installer. I haven't tested this yet or even looked at it.
      We will check it into the svn repo so it can be worked on.
    </li>

    <li>
      Installer should be able to check for updates for a release, and install
      it for the user.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
      Slapt-get compliance with slack-required files. Its partially done. Files are
      there for each package, they just need to be populated
  </li>

  <li>
    add update-mime-database and update-desktop-database to doinst.sh scripts
    that need them. See drivel's doinst.sh file for an example of how to
    implement this.
  </li>

  <li>
    Scrollkeeper taking too long to update from doinst.sh scripts. Anyone
    know how to fix this?
  </li>
  
  <li>
    add .desktop entries to any packages that do not have them
  </li>
  
  <li>update some slackbuilds
  <ul>
    <li>
      NetworkManager - does not build with startup-notification-1.8,
      maybe try cvs build
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    fix up slack-desc files, some of them have very sparse descriptions
  </li>
</ol>
