GNOME 3.0 has largely abandoned the libgnome libraries in favour for GTK+3.
However, a number of older GNOME applications may still expect to find some of
these libraries on the system.  Nothing in the official gsb/ tree requires
these libraries, so these packages are only supplied for convenience.  :^)
