This document explains how to upgrade from GNOME SlackBuild 2.22.3 to GSB 2.24.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For details of important changes from GSB 2.22.3 to 2.24.0, see the file 'CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT'.  

Before you begin, we would strongly recommend making a backup of your system, or, if not the 
entire system, at least the /etc directory.  You might find that you need to refer to a few 
things after the upgrade process is complete. Back it up, or take your chances.  

There are two ways of upgrading your system:

	A.  Slapt-get.
	B.  Local copy of the packages.


A. Slapt-get
-------------

0.  Make sure to put your machine single-user mode:
    $ telinit 1

    However, note that this method will actually need internet access, so before we can 
    continue, make sure that you can actually use networking. :^)

1.  Remove obsolete packages.  The CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT file should have a list of these.  
    You can remove these using 'removepkg'.

2.  Make sure that your /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc file has been updated to point both to a 
    valid Slackware 12.1 repository as well as a gsb-2.24 stable repository.  
    $ vi /etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc

3.  Make sure we're using the latest package information from these repositories.
    $ slapt-get --update

4.  Upgrade your system.
    $ slapt-get --upgrade

    And away it should go, upgrading every installed package of GSB. This may well take a long 
    time to finish, and will depend on your download speed.  

5.  Fix your config files.  Some of the config files in /etc are going to need your attention, 
    for example PulseAudio, or NetworkManager.  You'll find the new incoming config files on  
    your system with the ".new" extension, or in some cases, your old configurations may have 
    been moved to ".old"  You may need to fill these in with information from your old config 
    files and then move them over.  

6.  Reboot your machine.
    $ reboot

    A reboot is recommended.  Dbus, and other servies should be restarted, and icon caches 
    remade.  If you want to use GDM, you'll need to edit your /etc/inittab to start in run 
    level 4.  At this point you should be running GNOME SlackBuild 2.24.0.

7.  xwmconfig

    If you use `startx` to start an Xsession, you can run xwmconfig to choose xinitrc.gnome, 
    or for those of you with an awesome graphics card, try xinitrc.gnome-compiz to run GNOME 
    with Compiz-Fusion as a window manager.



B. Local copy of the packages
------------------------------

To do this, you'll need the GNOME SlackBuild 2.24.0 packages.  The packages don't have to be 
on a CD-ROM, as an alternative you could copy the slackware directory (the one with the 
various package subdirectories in it, basically the "gsb" directory from the ftp site) to 
someplace like /root/gsb/.  The important thing is that you know where the gsb 
packages directory is.  We'll use /root/gsb in the following examples.

0.  Put your machine in single-user mode:
    $ telinit 1

1.  Remove obsolete packages.  The CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT file should have a list of these.  
    You can remove these using 'removepkg'.

2.  Upgrade your libraries.
    $ upgradepkg /root/gsb/packages/libraries/*.tgz

3.  Upgrade everything else: 
    $ upgradepkg /root/gsb/packages/*/*.tgz

    Or if you want to install a full GSB system, try running
    $ upgradepkg --install-new /root/gsb/packages/*/*.tgz

4.  Fix your config files.  Some of the config files in /etc are going to need your attention, 
    for example PulseAudio, or NetworkManager.  You'll find the new incoming config files on  
    your system with the ".new" extension, or in some cases, your old configurations may have 
    been moved to ".old"  You may need to fill these in with information from your old config 
    files and then move them over.  

5.  Reboot your machine.
    $ reboot

    A reboot is recommended.  Dbus, and other servies should be restarted, and icon caches 
    remade.  If you want to use GDM, you'll need to edit your /etc/inittab to start in run 
    level 4.  At this point you should be running GNOME SlackBuild 2.24.0.

6.  xwmconfig

    If you use `startx` to start an Xsession, you can run xwmconfig to choose xinitrc.gnome, 
    or for those of you with an awesome graphics card, try xinitrc.gnome-compiz to run GNOME 
    with Compiz-Fusion as a window manager.

At this point you should be running GNOME SlackBuild 2.24.0.

Good luck!
