*** OTHER NOTABLE CHANGES AND HINTS ***

- We needed to replace Slackware's DBUS system.  There are a number of 
GNOME applications, including gnome-session and vinagre, among others, 
that require the latest dbus that supports the new 
UpdateActivationEnvironment bus API.  MAKE SURE TO MOVE ANY *.new files 
in /etc/dbus-1 into their proper location.

- Someone pointed out that we were using the development version of 
Liferea and not the stable version.  Oops.  So we reverted to the stable 
version.  However, slapt-get will not change the package because of the 
higher version of the devel package.  You may want to removepkg liferea 
and install the "stable" version.

- If NetworkManager is running, but unused, Firefox will try to detect 
an available connection and start up in offline mode (annoyingly).  You 
can fix this behavior by disabling Network Manager if you're not using 
it.

- Gnome-do copies its dlls into the user's home directory 
.local/share/gnome-do/plugins, and will consequently not use the 
recompiled dlls and may fail on start up.  If this occurs, simply 
remove the .local copy and restart Gnome-Do.

- Make sure to remove system-tools-backends, liboobs, and 
gnome-system-tools.  They are rather broken in Slackware, and so we have 
removed them from GSB.  It looks doubtful whether they will re-enter at 
a later date.  For the time being, users are encouraged to use the 
command-line utilities that come with Slackware for system maintenance. 
We will try to offer a package which will put some icons in the GNOME 
system menu for these utilities.  

- Before upgrading your previous GSB installation, make sure to remove 
all the "removed" packages (listed above) from your system before 
installing any new packages.  For example, gst-pulse has been subsumed 
into gst-plugins-good.  The other packages are considered obsolete.  
Gnopernicus has been replaced by Orca, gnome-keyring-manager by 
seahorse, etc.  It's best to remove these packages first to avoid 
conflicts.

- Mozilla Seamonkey is probably best avoided.  We recommend you 
uninstall it from your system as it may lead to conflicts with XULRunner 
or Firefox.  Some programs, like devhelp, yelp, MonoDoc, and other 
applications which are built using Mozilla libaries may get confused as 
to which libraries it should use.  `removepkg seamonkey` is your best 
bet.  Unless of course you really do like Seamonkey.  :^)  If you're 
desperate to keep it around, make sure to remove the seamonkey line from 
your /etc/ld.so.conf and re-run ldconfig.

- All packages that are built to replace a standard Slackware package 
are configured, and built as closely as possible to how Patrick does it.  
However, we could not avoid this time around replacing some major 
software.  For more information about what needs to be replaced, and 
why, please see our 'REPLACED_PACKAGES.TXT'.  

- Poppler needed to be replaced unfortunately, but we have rebuilt it 
with Qt bindings enabled to avoid breaking any KDE compatability.

- Our Boost C++ libraries are built against libICU and with the 
official HotFix patches.

- GSB now comes with PolicyKit/ConsoleKit support.  We have included a 
default /etc/PolicyKit/PolicyKit.conf file with basic USB pluggable 
permissions, and some other examples to show to use the file.  See the 
manual page PolicyKit.conf(5) for the file format. In order to make use 
of PolicyKit, be sure to have the consolekit installed as well when 
you're running your GNOME session, otherwise, the PolicyKit will largely 
be ignored.
