CHANGES AND HINTS
=================
This file documents the instructions for upgrading to GNOME SlackBuild 2.26.3
for Slackware 13.0, and lists any packages which have been added, removed,
renamed, and/or split during the development cycle from GSB 2.26.3 for
Slackware 12.2, as well as note some potential "gotchas" that users can avoid
by arming themselves with a little knowledge.

All packages that are built to replace a standard Slackware package are
configured and built as closely as possible to how Patrick does.  For more
information about what needs to be replaced, and why, please see our
'SLACKWARE-13.0_REPLACED_PACKAGES.TXT'.  

DIRECTORY RESTRUCTURE
=====================
GNOME SlackBuild has gone under a directory restructuring to bring it more into
line with Slackware's own practice.  All our packages have been assigned to
sets now, along with tagfiles.  This will help us to develop a Slackware type
installer for GNOME SlackBuild as well as still being able to offer a slapt-get
based installation.  

GPG SIGNED PACKAGED
===================
All packages are now signed with gpg, and you can find the public key as
./GPG-KEY.  If you are using slapt-get to download and install your packages,
make sure to run:

  $ slapt-get --add-keys

UPDATES ABOUT SLAPT-GET
=============================
With the latest version of slapt-get, be sure to add a ":CUSTOM" tag to the end
of your SOURCE line which points to the GNOME SlackBuild repository.
Otherwise, the official Slackware package will outweigh some GNOME SlackBuild
required package and they may not be installed.

*** OTHER NOTABLE CHANGES AND HINTS ***

- Fix your config files.  Some of the config files in /etc are going to need
  your attention.  You'll find the new incoming config files on your system
with the ".new" extension.  You may need to fill these in with information from
your old config files and then move them over.

- Slackware now offers packages seamonkey-solibs and seamonkey.  Be aware that
  these packages can cause conflicts with GNOMESlackBuild's nss and xulrunner
packages (in the n set).  We have marked them as "conflicts" in the
slack-conflicts file.  If you want to use seamonkey, make sure to remove its
entry from the /etc/ld.so.conf file, and re-run ldconfig.  Note that epiphany,
and many packages like heimdal-libs and evolution will look for the GSB version
of xulrunner and nss.  

- When adding users to the netdev group, in order to use NetworkManager and the
  network-manager-applet, you may need to reload dbus in order for the new
permissions to take effect.

- Pulseaudio will grab the ALSA sound device, which may block other
  applications from using sound while pulseaudio is running.  You may wish to
install the alsa-plugins package, and then configure your /etc/asound.conf file
to force ALSA to use pulesaudio.  This may be handy if you want to use flash
video as well as using other pulsified applications.

- You user must be in the 'audio' group to use audio, the 'netdev' group to use
  avahi and NetworkManager, the 'plugdev' to use BlueTooth and removeable media
in Nautilus, and the 'power' group to use hibernate/suspend with GNOME Power
Manager and use the CPUfreq applet.

- If NetworkManager is running, but unused, Firefox will try to detect an
  available connection and start up in offline mode (annoyingly).  You can fix
this behavior by disabling NetworkManager if you're not using it.

- GSB comes with PolicyKit/ConsoleKit support.  We have included a default
  /etc/PolicyKit/PolicyKit.conf file with basic USB pluggable permissions, and
some other examples to show to use the file.  See the manual page
PolicyKit.conf(5) for the file format. In order to make use of PolicyKit, be
sure to have the consolekit installed as well when you're running your GNOME
session, otherwise, the PolicyKit will largely be ignored.  (If you run
ck-list-session from a GNOME terminal you can see if consolekit is running.)
You will need to run consolekit if you want to reboot or shutdown from the
gnome-menu or use some utilities such as the GNOME cpufreq applet.  For such
things, it might be necessary to use polkit-gnome-authorization (run as root)
and grant your user the abilities to use applications configured to use
PolicyKit authorisations.
