Slackware 12.2 has added numerous packages as well that supplant older 
GSB packages. If you were running an older version of GSB and now upgrading,
Please see SLACKWARE-12.2_CONFLICTS.TXT for more details.

*** OTHER NOTABLE CHANGES AND HINTS ***

- If you are experiencing a 100% usage of your X process when running GNOME, 
please see our XORG_PACKAGES.TXT for more information about this bug in X.

- You user must be in the 'audio' group to use audio, the 'netdev' group to use
avahi and NetworkManager, the 'plugdev' to use BlueTooth and removeable
media in Nautilus, and the 'power' group to use hibernate/suspend with GNOME
Power Manager.

- Slackware 12.2's newer dbus package has a stricter security model.  Avahi now
supplies a separate /etc/dbus-1/system-local.conf file which enables signal sending.
This shouldn't be a major security issue, but users should be aware that when installing
the GSB avahi package, the dbus security model does open up slightly. 

- PolicyKit and ConsoleKit have been rigourously revamped.  Be sure to install any
".new" files in your /etc (`find . -name "*.new"`) and either overwrite your old
settings, or incorporate the new configurations.  Otherwise, things may go wrong. 

- If NetworkManager is running, but unused, Firefox will try to detect 
an available connection and start up in offline mode (annoyingly).  You 
can fix this behavior by disabling NetworkManager if you're not using 
it.

- Gnome-do copies its dlls into the user's home directory 
.local/share/gnome-do/plugins, and will consequently not use the 
recompiled dlls and may fail on start up.  If this occurs, simply 
remove the .local copy and restart Gnome-Do.

- Before upgrading your previous GSB installation, make sure to remove 
all the "removed" packages (listed above) from your system before 
installing any new packages.  For example, gst-pulse has been subsumed 
into gst-plugins-good.  The other packages are considered obsolete.  
Gnopernicus has been replaced by Orca, gnome-keyring-manager by 
seahorse, etc.  It's best to remove these packages first to avoid 
conflicts. See also SLACKWARE-12.2_CONFLICTS.TXT.

- Mozilla Seamonkey is probably best avoided.  We recommend you 
uninstall it from your system as it may lead to conflicts with XULRunner 
or Firefox.  Some programs, like devhelp, yelp, MonoDoc, and other 
applications which are built using Mozilla libaries may get confused as 
to which libraries it should use.  `removepkg seamonkey` is your best 
bet.  Unless of course you really do like Seamonkey.  :^)  If you're 
desperate to keep it around, make sure to remove the seamonkey line from 
your /etc/ld.so.conf and re-run ldconfig.

- All packages that are built to replace a standard Slackware package 
are configured and built as closely as possible to how Patrick does it.  
However, we could not avoid this time around replacing some major 
software.  For more information about what needs to be replaced, and 
why, please see our 'SLACKWARE-12.2_REPLACED_PACKAGES.TXT'.  

- Poppler needed to be replaced unfortunately, but we have rebuilt it 
with Qt bindings enabled to avoid breaking any KDE compatability.

- Our Boost C++ libraries are built against libICU.

- GSB now comes with PolicyKit/ConsoleKit support.  We have included a 
default /etc/PolicyKit/PolicyKit.conf file with basic USB pluggable 
permissions, and some other examples to show to use the file.  See the 
manual page PolicyKit.conf(5) for the file format. In order to make use 
of PolicyKit, be sure to have the consolekit installed as well when 
you're running your GNOME session, otherwise, the PolicyKit will largely 
be ignored.  (If you run ck-list-session from a GNOME terminal you can 
see if consolekit is running.)  You will need to run consolekit if you 
want to reboot or shutdown from the gnome-menu or use some utilities 
such as the GNOME cpufreq applet.  For such things, it might be 
necessary to use polkit-gnome-authorization (run as root) and grant your 
user the abilities to use applications configured to use PolicyKit 
authorisations.
