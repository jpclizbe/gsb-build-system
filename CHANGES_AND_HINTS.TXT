CHANGES AND HINTS
=================
This file documents the instructions for upgrading to GNOME SlackBuild 2.30.0
for Slackware 13.1, and lists any packages which have been added, removed,
renamed, and/or split during the development cycle from GSB 2.26.3 for
Slackware 13.1, as well as note some potential "gotchas" that users can avoid
by arming themselves with a little knowledge.

All packages that are built to replace a standard Slackware package are
configured and built as closely as possible to how Patrick does.  For more
information about what needs to be replaced, and why, please see our
'SLACKWARE-13.1_REPLACED_PACKAGES.TXT'.  

GPG SIGNED PACKAGED
===================
All packages are now signed with gpg, and you can find the public key as
./GPG-KEY.  If you are using slapt-get to download and install your packages,
make sure to run:

  $ slapt-get --add-keys

UPDATES ABOUT SLAPT-GET
=============================
With the latest version of slapt-get, be sure to add a ":CUSTOM" tag to the end
of your SOURCE line which points to the GNOME SlackBuild repository.
Otherwise, the official Slackware package will outweigh some GNOME SlackBuild
required package and they may not be installed.  


*** PACKAGE ADDITIONS SINCE 2.26.3 for Slackware 13.1 ***

a/libxklavier: Added.  Upgrades standard Slackware package.
n/libpst: Added.
a/pango: Added.  Upgrades standard Slackware package.
l/pygobject: Added.  Upgrades standard Slackware package.
l/vte: Added.  Upgrades standard Slackware package.

  qt3-compat).  If you require the poppler qt3 bindings, then do not upgrade,
  since this package only needs replacing if you want to use evince 2.30.0.
a/gnome-icon-theme-2.30.0-i486-1gsb.txz: Added.  Upgrades Slackware package.
l/gmime: Added.  This needs to replace the standard Slackware package, and used
  by totem-pl-parser and GNOME 2.30 for gmime handling.  
l/gstreamer: Added.  Required by libcanberra, gnome-control-panel, and GNOME
  2.30 media backends.  
a/libxklavier: Added.  This replaces the default Slackware package.  Library
  version are the same, so the upgrade shouldn't affect any applications

*** PACKAGE REMOVALS SINCE 2.26.3 for Slackware 13.1 ***

None.

*** OTHER NOTABLE CHANGES AND HINTS ***

- Where did my icons go?  GNOME 2.30 menus and buttons have been standardised
  across all applications to not display icons by default. Menu items with
dynamic objects, including applications, files or bookmarks, and devices are the
exception and can display an icon. This change will standardise the look and
feel of menus and present a cleaner interface to users.  You can turn this on
and off using the 'Appearance' settings (under Interface). 

- Remember to fix your config files.  Some of the config files in /etc are
  going to need your attention.  You'll find the new incoming config files on
your system with the ".new" extension.  You may need to fill these in with
information from your old config files and then move them over.

- Slackware now offers packages seamonkey-solibs and seamonkey.  Be aware that
  these packages can cause conflicts with GNOMESlackBuild's nss and xulrunner
packages (in the n set), and possibly other packages which depend on xulrunner
and nss.  We have marked them as "conflicts" in the slack-conflicts file.  If
you want to use seamonkey, make sure to remove its entry from the
/etc/ld.so.conf file, and re-run ldconfig.  Note that epiphany, and many
packages like heimdal-libs and evolution will look for the GSB version of
xulrunner and nss.  

- When adding users to the netdev group (in order to use NetworkManager and the
  network-manager-applet) you may need to reload dbus in order for the new
permissions to take effect.

- Pulseaudio will grab the ALSA sound device, which may block other
  applications from using sound while pulseaudio is running.  You may wish to
install the alsa-plugins package, and then configure your /etc/asound.conf file
to force ALSA to use pulesaudio.  This may be handy if you want to use flash
video as well as using other pulsified applications.

- You user must be in the 'audio' group to use audio, the 'netdev' group to use
  avahi and NetworkManager, the 'plugdev' to use BlueTooth and removeable media
in Nautilus, and the 'power' group to use hibernate/suspend with GNOME Power
Manager and use the CPUfreq applet.  (If you are not in the 'power' group, the
CPUfreq applet will complain "CPU frequency scaling unsupported.")

- If NetworkManager is running, but unused, Firefox will try to detect an
  available connection and start up in offline mode (annoyingly).  You can fix
this behavior by disabling NetworkManager if you're not using it.
