This file documents the instructions for upgrading to GNOME SlackBuild
2.26.3 for Slackware 13.0, and lists any packages which have been
added, removed, renamed, and/or split during the development cycle
from GSB 2.26.3 for Slackware 12.2, as well as note some potential
"gotchas" that users can avoid by arming themselves with a little
knowledge.

All packages that are built to replace a standard Slackware package
are configured and built as closely as possible to how Patrick does
it.  However, we could not avoid this time around replacing some major
software.  For more information about what needs to be replaced, and
why, please see our 'SLACKWARE-13.0_REPLACED_PACKAGES.TXT'.  

First of all, GNOME SlackBuild has gone under a directory
restructuring to bring it more into line with Slackware's own
practice.  All our packages have been assigned to sets now, along with
tagfiles.  This will help us to develop a Slackware type installer for
GNOME SlackBuild as well as still being able to offer a slapt-get
based installation.  

Also, all packages are now signed with gpg, and you can find the
public key as GPG-KEY.  If you are using slapt-get to download and
install your packages, make sure to run:
  $ slapt-get --add-keys

NOTE ABOUT SLAPT-GET
=============================
With the latest version of slapt-get, be sure to add a ":CUSTOM" tag
to the end of your SOURCE line which points to the GNOME SlackBuild
repository.  Otherwise, the official Slackware package will outweigh
some required package and they may not be installed.

*** OTHER NOTABLE CHANGES AND HINTS ***

- When adding users to the netdev group, in order to use NetworkManager
  and the network-manager-applet, you may need to reload dbus in order
  for the new permissions to take effect.

- Pulseaudio will grab the ALSA sound device, which may block other
  applications from using sound while pulseaudio is running.  You may
wish to install the alsa-plugins package, and then configure your
/etc/asound.conf file to force ALSA to use pulesaudio.  This may be
handy if you want to use flash video as well as using other pulsified
applications.

- You user must be in the 'audio' group to use audio, the 'netdev'
  group to use avahi and NetworkManager, the 'plugdev' to use
BlueTooth and removeable media in Nautilus, and the 'power' group to
use hibernate/suspend with GNOME Power Manager.

- If NetworkManager is running, but unused, Firefox will try to detect
  an available connection and start up in offline mode (annoyingly).
You can fix this behavior by disabling NetworkManager if you're not
using it.

- Poppler needed to be replaced unfortunately, but we have rebuilt it
  with Qt bindings enabled to avoid breaking any KDE compatability.

- Our Boost C++ libraries are built against libICU.

- GSB now comes with PolicyKit/ConsoleKit support.  We have included a
  default /etc/PolicyKit/PolicyKit.conf file with basic USB pluggable
permissions, and some other examples to show to use the file.  See the
manual page PolicyKit.conf(5) for the file format. In order to make
use of PolicyKit, be sure to have the consolekit installed as well
when you're running your GNOME session, otherwise, the PolicyKit will
largely be ignored.  (If you run ck-list-session from a GNOME terminal
you can see if consolekit is running.)  You will need to run
consolekit if you want to reboot or shutdown from the gnome-menu or
use some utilities such as the GNOME cpufreq applet.  For such things,
it might be necessary to use polkit-gnome-authorization (run as root)
and grant your user the abilities to use applications configured to
use PolicyKit authorisations.
