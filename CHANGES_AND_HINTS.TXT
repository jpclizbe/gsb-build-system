CHANGES AND HINTS
=================
This file documents the instructions for upgrading to GNOME SlackBuild 3.0
for Slackware 13.2, and lists any packages which have been added, removed,
renamed, and/or split during the development cycle from GSB 2.32.0 for
Slackware 13.1, as well as note some potential "gotchas" that users can avoid
by arming themselves with a little knowledge.

All packages that are built to replace a standard Slackware package are
configured and built as closely as possible to how Patrick does.  For more
information about what needs to be replaced, and why, please see our
'README_REPLACED_PACKAGES.TXT'.  

This version of GNOME SlackBuild has been considerably slimmed down.  It is
difficult to maintain to a high quality so many peripheral packages. A full
GNOME desktop, and a variety of office, multimedia, and networking applications
is still offered.  Please check the 'Package Removals' section below for
details.  Before installing or upgrading GSB, you are encourage to use
'--remove-obsolete' when doing upgrades.

GPG SIGNED PACKAGED
===================
All packages are now signed with gpg, and you can find the public key as
./GPG-KEY.  If you are using slapt-get to download and install your packages,
make sure to run:

  $ slapt-get --add-keys

UPDATES ABOUT SLAPT-GET
=============================
With the latest version of slapt-get, be sure to add a ":CUSTOM" tag to the end
of your SOURCE line which points to the GNOME SlackBuild repository.
Otherwise, the official Slackware package will outweigh some GNOME SlackBuild
required package and they may not be installed.

None.

*** OTHER NOTABLE CHANGES AND HINTS ***

- "Suspend" now shows up by default in the user status menu; however, "Power
  Off" is hidden and only shows up while holding down the Alt key.

- By default, GNOME Shell does not have the minimize and maximize buttons
  enabled in the window title bars.  To maximise, you must drag a window to the
top of the screen to maximize it. More problematically, there are no close
button in the titlebar for the windows that have a "Close" button in the
dialog.  If you wish to re-enable your window titlebar buttons:

 $ gconftool-2 -s -t string /desktop/gnome/shell/windows/button_layout \
      ":minimize,maximize,close"

- Remember to fix your config files.  Some of the config files in /etc are
  going to need your attention.  You'll find the new incoming config files on
your system with the ".new" extension.  You may need to fill these in with
information from your old config files and then move them over.
