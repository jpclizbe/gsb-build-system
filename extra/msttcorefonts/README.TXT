This package contains the Microsoft TrueType core fonts for the Web.
These fonts can be distributed only in their original format (.exe).
Putting the .ttf files inside a tarball is not legally allowed, so the
SlackBuild script downloads these fonts as separate .exe files in the
original format which is perfectly legal. These files are no longer
available for download from microsoft.com but can be downloaded for
free from here:
- http://sourceforge.net/projects/corefonts/

By using these fonts you agree to Microsoft's EULA which is available
in the corefonts package's document directory as 'EULA.txt'.
