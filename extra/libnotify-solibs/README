GNOME 3.0 requires the latest libnotify 0.7 which is *NOT* API-backwards
compatible:

The required upgrade to libnotify-0.7 will break some packages, particularly
xfce-notifyd and system-config-printer.  There may be other packages as well.
You can either remove these package, or if you want to get them working, you
will need install our libnotify-solibs package which simply repackages the
official Slackware libnotify usr/lib*/libnotify.so.* into your /usr/lib so that
these applications can continue to run.
