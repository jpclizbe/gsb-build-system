	GNU-ification

2007-10-06  Chip Cuccio <chipster@gnomeslackbuild.org>

	ChangeLog_proposed:
	*  Testing

2007-10-06  Chip Cuccio <chipster@gnomeslackbuild.org>

	ChangeLog_Proposed:
	*  It worked!

2007-10-06  Chip Cuccio <chipster@gnomeslackbuild.org>

	ChangeLog_proposed:
	*  I'm proposing that we simply automate the ChangeLog by using the log
	   entires when ci'ing code.  By Entering the changes like so, the ChangeLog
	   will automagically get GNU-ified by my hatckery.
	Foo:
	*  This file doesn't exist, it's just a sample change entry to "Foo"
	*  And so is this.

2007-10-06  fidesratio

	Some documentation for the SlackBuilds.

2007-10-05  tadgy

	gsb.options:
	  * PKGDEST should be set to: ${PKGDEST:-$TMP/gsb-packages} in the
	    SlackBuilds - export it to the environment if you don't like the
	    default.  Plus the variable in gsb.options was wrong anyway - it
	    was PKG_DEST not PKGTEST.
	  * ARCH should be set to: ${ARCH:-i586} in the SlackBuilds.  The
	    default (i586) should only be over-ridden by an explicitly set
	    environment variable, not an option somewhere hiden from the user.
	  * BUILD should never be set here.  Over-riding the SlackBuilds is a
	    very bad idea.  Let the updater do this.
	  * DISTRO should be set to: ${DISTRO:-slackware} in the SlackBuilds.
	    We are a GNOME build for *Slackware* not *Slamd64*.  Out of the box
	    GSB *will* build correctly for Slackware and a 32bit x86 arch.
	    If you want something else, set the environment variables.

	  Therefore, gsb.options is dead, DEAD, D E A D.  Leave it that way :)
