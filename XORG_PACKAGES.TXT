Notice about GNOME 2.26 and Slackware X.Org 1.4.2 Bug

There is a bug in events handling code of X.Org's 1.4.2 X server which
significantly noticeable with a good portion of GNOME's 2.26 software.

As a result, we have rebuilt Slackware's xorg-server, xorg-server-nest,
and xorg-server-xvfb packages using Pat's supplied SlackBuild scripts,
having applied an official X.org upstream patch available from GIT.  

If you notice that when you are running GNOME that your X process is
spiked at 100%, you may wish to replace your Slackware xorg packages
with our patched version which are supplied in extra/.
