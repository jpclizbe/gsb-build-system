TODO:

* perl bindings haven't been added yet, SlackBuild files need to be added
* gsb_update.pl - needs to do something useful, only has some layout and 
  config stuff atm
* abiword crashes
* left out openldap and cyrus-sasl for evolution.
  maybe make ldap in evolution statically built in
* check gdm, see how it starts, check Xsession variables for sessions in 
  global Xsession file
* shared-mime-info, add update to install scripts
* add xscreensaver, xchat, gimp, hicolor-icon-theme to gsb
