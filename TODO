TODO:

* perl bindings haven't been added yet, SlackBuild files need to be added
* gsb_update.pl - needs to do something useful, only has some layout and 
  config stuff atm
* left out openldap and cyrus-sasl for evolution.
  maybe make ldap in evolution statically built in
* add xscreensaver, xchat, gimp, hicolor-icon-theme to gsb
* add a HACKING file with instructions on how to edit and add things to the
  source tree
