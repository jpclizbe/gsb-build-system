-- Required Package Replacements for GNOME 2.26.3 on Slackware-current --

alsa-lib:         ( > 1.0.19 required by pulseaudio 0.9.15, libcanberra, and 
                      gnome-control-center)
bluez:            ( > 4.2 bluez replaces bluez-utils/libs, required for gvfs
                    support for Bluetooth, and other GNOME 2.26 bluetooth userspace
                    applications)
glib2:            ( > 2.20 required by libgnome 2.26, gvfs 1.2.2, 
                      nautilus 2.26, etc.)
gtk+2:            ( > 2.16 required by gnome-panel 2.26.0, and others )

-- Recommended Replacements --

gst-plugins-base  ( > 0.10.22 rebuild against gvfs/gnomevfs to enable giosink, 
                    required by sound-juicer)
libgsf:           ( Slackware's libgsf lacks GNOME support; required 
                    for GNOME Office applications like Gnumeric)
gnome-icon-theme  ( We offer an updated gnome-icon-theme package; 
                    better icons, and a rather trivial replacement.   
                    Update recommended.)

-- Optional Replacements --

compiz-fusion:    ( Slackware comes with compiz 0.7.4; our 
                    compiz-fusion is offers GNOME support, like CCSM and 
                    other goodies.)
pidgin:           ( We offer the latest stable Pidgin package with 
                    pulseaudio support for sounds in extra/.)
