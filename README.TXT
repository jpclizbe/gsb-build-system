|   |                   with Slackware 13.37, users may prefer
|   |                   to use our verion.

|-- pasture/            These are packages that have been removed
|   |                   from GNOME SlackBuild, but are useful enough to
|   |                   keep around.  Might not be secure.
|   |
|   |                   Packages currently found here include:
|   |
|   `-- source/         Source code for the pasture packages.
|
|-- source              This directory contains source code for the 
|   |                   packages that are offered by the GSB project.  
|   |                   It doesn't contains any	source tarballs (as 
|   |                   being too huge), but all the offical 
|   |                   SlackBuilds used to build GSB, as well as 
|   |                   slack-desc, slack-requireds, and any patches we 
|   |                   use. For more information about building GSB,

                        As the additions will not be part of GSB the 
                        directory is shipped empty.  The new features will 
                        continue development in the next gsb-current, 
                        possibly to be merged into the main tree for the
                        next GSB cycle.
