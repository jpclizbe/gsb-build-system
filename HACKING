THIS DOC IS JUST A ROUGH DRAFT, it is subject to change.


Just a small ammount of rules so that we can keep the sources consistent.

1) Before running svn diff:
   run clean_src.sh from the top level dir ( trunk/ ) so that the ARCH variables
   and BUILD variables are clean. eg:
       - The ARCH variable should always look like this in SVN:
             ARCH=${ARCH:-i486}
       - The BUILD variable should always be free of alpha characters.

2) ARCH specific patches:
   - Any patches that are specific to an ARCH should be named like this:
        x86_64.patch_to_fix_this.patch
        powerpc.some_patch_to_fix_this.patch

3) Commits should be atomic. So when there is a version update in gsb_update, the 
   corresponding updates in the src/ tree should be commited at the same time.
   An example commit would be the following:
     svn ci bin/gsb_update src/

4) Log messages should be somewhat descriptive for anything other than version
   updates
