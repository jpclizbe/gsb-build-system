Notes for hackers
-----------------

* Before starting to hack it's a good idea to stop by #gsb on irc.freenode.net
  to discuss the changes or work you'd like to make - we do have plans for the
  future development of the project, so make sure your changes won't conflict
  with our plans.

* Unless you have svn commit access we will require an 'svn diff' of your
  changes to the tree.  Please use 'svn diff' - we cannot work with the
  output of a simple 'diff'.  Mail the diff to the gsb-dev mailing list.

* Before doing the 'svn diff' run this command from the top level dir (trunk/):
    bin/clean_src.sh
  This will clean the BUILD, VERSION and ARCH variables in the SlackBuilds.

* Patches should have descriptive names, eg: fix-broken-something.patch.
  If a patch is ARCH specific it should include the architecture it is
  intended for in the filename.  eg: i586.fix-broken-something.patch.
  If a patch can be used on multiple architectures (like i586, i686 etc)
  a symlink should be used from the original filename to each of the arch
  specific names.

* Commits and patches should be atomic.  If a version number update is made
  to the gsb_update system, the corresponding updates in the src/ tree should
  be done at the same time.

* Commit log messages should be descriptive.

* Keep the VERSIONS file up to date.

* Keep the ChangeLog up to date.

* Credit yourself in CREDITS.

* Don't commit changes to generic.SlackBuild without talking to Tadgy or Steve
  (fidesratio) first.

* Don't add any src/gsb.options you may have on your system to SVN.  We do not
  need your customisation options in the main repo.

* If you add a new package to the build system please use the template
  generic.SlackBuild, doinst.sh and slack-* files in the lib/gsb/ directory.
