				SVN Branches
				============

We currently maintain several SVN branches to produce our GSB releases.  The
following is a list of our trees and the URIs which should be used to 'svn co'
them.

Bleeding edge 'gsb-current' tree:
  http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/trunk/

  This tree contains the latest and most up to date GSB sources.  As such, at
  any time it may be broken (ie, will not build fully) or may cause your system
  to explode in a shower of wires and capacitors if you run it.
  This tree is usually only for the latest Slackware/Slamd64 current and may
  not work on other releases.

GNOME 2.22 tree:
  http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/branches/gsb-2.22/

  This is our GNOME 2.22 stable tree for Slackware 12.1 and Slamd64 current
  (which will soon become Slamd64 12.1) ONLY.
  This tree is kept up to date with the GNOME 2.22 sources and will be
  maintained (at least for the short->medium timeframe) with the minor
  2.22.x releases GNOME provide.

GNOME 2.20 tree:
  http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/branches/gsb-2.20/

  This is our GNOME 2.20 stable tree for Slackware and Slamd64 12.0 ONLY.
  This tree is kept up to date with the GNOME 2.20 sources and will be
  maintained (at least for the short->medium timeframe) with the minor
  2.20.x releases GNOME provide.
