GNOME SlackBuild 2.32 for x86 and x86_64 is released!

Things are very stable.  A lot of weight has been trimmed in this release of
GSB, and we now only need to replace two Slackware packages.  The desktop is
solid, responsive and polished and comes with a full set of great GNOME
applications.  Please make sure to read CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT to see what has
changed in this release, and for a few potential gotchas.  We have also written
up a FAQ.TXT which has some further hints and tips about getting the most out
of your new GNOME 2.32 desktop.

The next set of GNOME maintenance patches will be out in a few weeks.  For now,
enjoy!
