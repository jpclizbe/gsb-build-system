			    Testing Packages for GNOME SlackBuild
			    ======================================

The packages in this section have not been thoroughly tested yet, or provide
just the initial support for upcoming features, or are offered for users who
may wish to use them despite the availability of offical Slackware packages.

You are free to install these packages if you wish - they shouldn't harm your
system; but installing them is at YOUR OWN RISK and we will not provide a lot
of support for them.

Available packages
-----------------

openoffice3 - 
        OpenOffice.org 3.0 is the latest version of Sun's full-featured 
        open-source office suite that is compatible with all other major 
        office software.  We consider the 2.4 series the "stable" series,
        however, we offer the new 3.0 series here.  It should be largely
        stable, but there are always bugs in a new release, so we continue
        to offer the 2.4 series as stable, and users who wish to try out
        3.0 can install it from the testing/ directory.

        NOTE: The openoffice3 package can be installed beside a 2.4 package
        and both can run on the same system without conflict.  So feel 
        free to install the 3.0 series and give it a try.  :^)

gnome-menus-ooo3 -
        This package contains a modified set of GNOME Menus which include
        a set of submenus which display OpenOffice.org 3.0 in order to 
        better integrate OOo into your GNOME Desktop.
