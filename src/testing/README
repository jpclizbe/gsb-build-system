The packages below are in testing either because their haven't been thoroughly
tested yet, or are just the initial support for upcoming features.

Packages in Testing
-------------

libtelepathy: (Telepathy Flexible Communications Framework)
  The Telepathy project is building a unified framework for many
  different kinds of real-time communications, such as instant messaging
  (both one-to-one and in groups), voice calls and video calls.  It uses
  the D-Bus messaging system to provide a simple interface for client
  applications, allowing them to quickly take advantage of Telepathy's
  benefits.  Telepathy will slowly be intergrated into the GNOME Desktop, 
  and so it is here in testing for users to preview if they wish.
