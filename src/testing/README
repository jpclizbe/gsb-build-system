			    Testing Packages
			    ================

The packages in this section have not been thoroughly tested yet, or provide
just the initial support for upcoming features, or are offered for users who
may wish to use them despite the availability of offical Slackware packages.

You are free to install these packages if you wish - they shouldn't harm your
system; but installing them is at YOUR OWN RISK and we will not provide a lot
of support for them.
