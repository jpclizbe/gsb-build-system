heimdal: heimdal (Heimdal Kerberos 5 Implementation)
heimdal:
heimdal: Heimdal is a free implementation of Kerberos 5, protocol compatible 
heimdal: with RFC 4120 and MIT Kerberos V5.  Kerberos is a system for authenticating 
heimdal: users and services on a network. It is built upon the assumption that the 
heimdal: network is unsafe. For example, data sent over the network can be 
heimdal: eavesdropped and altered, and addresses can also be faked. Therefore they 
heimdal: cannot be used for authentication purposes. Kerberos is a trusted third-party 
heimdal: service.
