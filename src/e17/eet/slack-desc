eet: eet - compression library for Enlightenment
eet:
eet: Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of
eet: data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a
eet: zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later
eet: on. It does not do zip as a zip itself has more complexity than is
eet: needed, and it was much simpler to implement this once here.
