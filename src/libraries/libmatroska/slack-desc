libmatroska:
libmatroska: Matroska aims to become THE standard of multimedia container formats. 
libmatroska: It was derived from a project called MCF, but differentiates from it 
libmatroska: significantly because it is based on EBML (Extensible Binary Meta 
libmatroska: Language), a binary derivative of XML. EBML enables the Matroska 
libmatroska: Development Team to gain significant advantages in terms of future 
libmatroska: format extensibility, without breaking file support in old parsers.
