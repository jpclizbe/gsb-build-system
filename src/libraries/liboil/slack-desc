liboil: liboil (Library of optimized functions for various CPUs)
liboil: 
liboil: Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for various 
liboil: CPUs. These functions are generally loops implementing simple 
liboil: algorithms, such as converting an array of N integers to floating-point
liboil: numbers or multiplying and summing an array of N numbers. Such functions 
liboil: are candidates for significant optimization using various techniques, 
liboil: especially by using extended instructions provided by modern CPUs 
liboil: (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).
