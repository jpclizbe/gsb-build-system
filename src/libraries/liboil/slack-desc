liboil: liboil (Library of optimized functions for various CPUs)
liboil: 
liboil: Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for various 
liboil: CPUs. These functions are generally loops implementing simple 
liboil: algorithms, such as converting an array of N integers to floating-point
liboil: numbers or multiplying and summing an array of N numbers. Such 
liboil: functions are candidates for significant optimization using various
liboil: techniques, especially by using extended instructions provided by 
liboil: modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).
