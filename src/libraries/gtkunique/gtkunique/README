GtkUnique - Single Instance Application Library
===============================================

DESCRIPTION

GtkUnique allows the creation of single instance application, that is
applications that can only have a single instance running at any given
time.  Once launched an instance, each new instance of the application
should simply exit() or (optionally) send a message to the running
instance and then exit() depending on the response value returned by
the running instance.

GtkUnique has various IPC backends:

  * D-Bus    - an instance is advertised as a D-Bus object
  * Xlbs     - an instance controls a X window object
  * libbacon - a unix socket is used as IPC

DEPENDENCIES

In order to build GtkUnique you will need:

  * glib >= 2.10.0
  * gtk+ >= 2.10.0

You will also need these libraries, depending on the chosen backend:

  * dbus-glib >= 0.70
  * xlibs-dev

BUILD

To build GtkUnique, launch:

  ./configure
  make all
  make install

You can pass the "--with-backend=<backend-name>" parameter to the
configure script to force the build of a specific backend; this will
disable some checks so you should do this only if you know what you
are doing.

HISTORY

GtkUnique began as a branch of the libguniqueapp library written by
Vytas Liuolia, with the guidance of Elijah Newren and Matthias Clasen,
for his Google Summer of Code project; the goal of the branch was
adding the Xlibs IPC backend.  It ended up changing most of the build
environment, the D-Bus protocol and adding a bidirectional IPC channel
instead of the original unidirectional one.

Still, this library would not exist without the work done by Vytas.
