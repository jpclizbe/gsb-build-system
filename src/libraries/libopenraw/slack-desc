libopenraw: libopenraw (Camera RAW Library)
libopenraw:
libopenraw: libopenraw is an ongoing project to provide a free software 
libopenraw: implementation for camera RAW files decoding. One of the main 
libopenraw: reason is that dcraw is not suited for easy integration into 
libopenraw: applications, and there is a need for an easy to use API to build 
libopenraw: free software digital image processing application.

libopenraw: It also has the goal to address missing feature from dcraw like 
libopenraw: meta-data decoding and easy thumbnail extraction.
