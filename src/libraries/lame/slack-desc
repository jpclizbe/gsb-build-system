lame:
lame: LAME Ain't an Mp3 Encoder. LAME started life as a GPL'd patch 
lame: against the dist10 ISO demonstration source, and thus was incapable 
lame: of producing an mp3 stream or even being compiled by itself. Now
lame: LAME is the source code for a fully LGPL'd MP3 encoder, with speed 
lame: and quality to rival and often surpass all commercial competitors.
