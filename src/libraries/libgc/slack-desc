libgc: libgc (Boehm Garbage Collector for C and C++)
libgc:
libgc: The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as 
libgc: a garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++. It allows you 
libgc: to allocate memory basically as you normally would, without explicitly 
libgc: deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector automatically 
libgc: recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be otherwise 
libgc: accessed.
