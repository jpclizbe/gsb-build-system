libatomic_ops: libatomic_ops (Library for Atomic Memory Operations)
libatomic_ops: 
libatomic_ops: libatomic_ops provides implementations for atomic memory update 
libatomic_ops: operations on a number of architectures. This allows direct use of 
libatomic_ops: these in reasonably portable code. It explicitly considers memory 
libatomic_ops: barrier semantics, and allows the construction of code that involves
libatomic_ops: minimum overhead across a variety of architectures.
