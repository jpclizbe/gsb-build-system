libatomic_ops: libatomic_ops (Library for Atomic Memory Operations)
libatomic_ops: 
libatomic_ops: libatomic_ops provides implementations for atomic memory update 
libatomic_ops: operations on a number of architectures. This allows direct use of these 
libatomic_ops: in reasonably portable code. It explicitly considers memory barrier 
libatomic_ops: semantics, and allows the construction of code that involves minimum 
libatomic_ops: overhead across a variety of architectures.
