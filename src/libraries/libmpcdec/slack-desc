libmpcdec:
libmpcdec: Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong emphasis on high 
libmpcdec: quality. It's not lossless, but it is designed for transparency, so 
libmpcdec: that you won't be able to hear differences between the original wave
libmpcdec: file and the much smaller MPC file.  It is based on the MPEG-1
libmpcdec: Layer-2 / MP2 algorithms.
