libmpcdec: libmpcdec (Musepack Decoder Library)
libmpcdec:
libmpcdec: Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong emphasis on high 
libmpcdec: quality. It's not lossless, but it is designed for transparency, so that 
libmpcdec: you won't be able to hear differences between the original wave file and 
libmpcdec: the much smaller MPC file.  It is based on the MPEG-1 Layer-2 / MP2 
libmpcdec: algorithms.
