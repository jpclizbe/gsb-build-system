libvisual: libvisual (Visualisation Library)
libvisual:
libvisual: Libvisual is meant as a framework that delivers audio visualisation 
libvisual: (read: eye candy generated to the current music you're playing) to 
libvisual: multimedia applications. It works by acting as a middle layer between 
libvisual: the visualisation plugin and application.  However libvisual provides 
libvisual: a lot more than just that middle layer, included is our own fourier 
libvisual: engine that supports any dft size, a super highly optimized math framework 
libvisual: for vectorized operations, an advanced video framework, gl intergration, 
libvisual: morphing between plugins, an universal plugin framework and a lot more.
