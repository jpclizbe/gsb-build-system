heimdal-libraries: heimdal-libraries (Heimdal Kerberos 5 Implementation)
heimdal-libraries:
heimdal-libraries: Heimdal is a free implementation of Kerberos 5, protocol compatible 
heimdal-libraries: with RFC 4120 and MIT Kerberos V5.  Kerberos is a system for authenticating 
heimdal-libraries: users and services on a network. It is built upon the assumption that the 
heimdal-libraries: network is unsafe. For example, data sent over the network can be 
heimdal-libraries: eavesdropped and altered, and addresses can also be faked. Therefore they 
heimdal-libraries: cannot be used for authentication purposes. Kerberos is a trusted third-party 
heimdal-libraries: service.
