The x264 subdirectory is external SVN link to
	svn://svn.videolan.org/x264/trunk
at a fixed revision.

The svn link is maintaned at a fixed revision so that daily changes to their
sources do not effect the stability of our builds.  We will only bump the svn
version during a development phase or because of a security issue.

*** IMPORTANT ***
When the svn sources are updated to a newer revision, lib/perl/GSB/Libraries.pm
MUST be updated with the new revision number (at the bottom of the file).
*****************

*** WARNING ***
x264 cannot be built for a target ARCH or be TUNE'ed to a specific CPU type.
The final package will only work on platforms similar to the one on which it
was built.
