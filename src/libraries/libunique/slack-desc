libunique: libunique (Single Instance Library)
libunique: 
libunique: libunique is a library for writing single instance application. If 
libunique: you launch a single instance application twice, the second instance 
libunique: will either just quit or will send a message to the running instance.  
libunique: Unique makes it easy to write this kind of applications, by providing 
libunique: a base class, taking care of all the IPC machinery needed to send 
libunique: messages to a running instance, and also handling the startup 
libunique: notification side.
