The mplayer subdirectory is external SVN link to
	svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/mplayer/trunk
at a fixed revision.

The svn link is maintaned at a fixed revision so that daily changes to their
sources do not effect the stability of our builds.  We will only bump the svn
version during a development phase or because of a security issue.

*** IMPORTANT ***
When the svn sources are updated to a newer revision, lib/perl/GSB/Supplied.pm
MUST be updated with the new revision number.
