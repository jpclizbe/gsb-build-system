GNOME Shell Extensions is a collection of extensions providing additional and
optional functionality to GNOME Shell.  The GNOME Shell extension design is
designed to give a high degree of power to the parts of the GNOME interface
managed by the shell, such as window management and application launching.

Available Extensions
====================

- alternate-tab: Lets you use classic Alt+Tab (window-based instead of
  app-based) in GNOME Shell.

- alternative-status-menu: For those who just cannot understand the design
  behind the current status menu, and want a power off item visible at all the
time. Adds the ability to hibernate as well.

- auto-move-windows: Lets you manage your workspaces more easily, assigning a
  specific workspace to each application as soon as it creates a window, in a
manner configurable with a GSettings key.

- dock: Shows a dock-style task switcher on the right side of the screen.

- example: A minimal example illustrating how to write extensions.

- gajim: Integration with Gajim, a Jabber/XMPP instant messaging client.

- user-theme: Loads a shell theme from ~/.themes/<name>/gnome-shell.

- windowsNavigator: Allow keyboard selection of windows and workspaces in
  overlay mode.

- xrandr-indicator: Replace the GTK+ based indicator from gnome-settings-daemon
  with a native one. Lets the user rotate the laptop monitor and open display
preferences quickly.
