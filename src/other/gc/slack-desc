gc: The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as
gc: a garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It allows
gc: you to allocate memory basically as you normally would, without
gc: explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The
gc: collector automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can
gc: no longer be otherwise accessed.
