gnome-speech:
gnome-speech: The gnome-speech component of GNOME provides a service-based approach to 
gnome-speech: speech synthesis engines. Each speech engine that is installed on the 
gnome-speech: system can be exposed as a speech service by gnome-speech, allowing 
gnome-speech: assistive technologies such as Orca to share the resource. Most of the 
gnome-speech: available synthesis engines on the Open Solaris and Linux platforms are 
gnome-speech: available via gnome-speech.
