The GNOME SlackBuild project uses go-oo (go-oo.org) as the basis for building
Openoffice.org. go-oo supplies milestone source balls in additional to
supplementary software used by openoffice (like mdbtools).  

This SlackBuild also creates various 'lang' packages.  They can be defined at
the top of the SlackBuild script.
