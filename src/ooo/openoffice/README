GSB uses go-oo (go-oo.org) as the basis for building Openoffice.org.  
go-oo supplies milestone source balls in additional to supplementary software used by openoffice (like 
mdbtools).  The GSB download scripts will keep the source in the svn tree, and copy them
over the build tree later (instead of running the ./download script which comes with ooo-build)
