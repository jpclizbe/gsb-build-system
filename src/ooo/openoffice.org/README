GSB uses go-oo (go-oo.org) as the basis for building Openoffice.org.  
go-oo supplies milestone source balls in additional to supplementary software used by openoffice (like 
mdbtools).  You'll need to be connected to the internet when running the SlackBuild because the script will 
invoke the "download" script which comes with the ooo-build source.
