libnjb: libnjb (Hardware audio player interface)
libnjb:
libnjb: libnjb is a C library and API for communicating with the Creative
libnjb: Nomad JukeBox and Dell DJ digital audio players under BSD, Linux, Mac
libnjb: OS X and Windows. The protocol these devices use is presumably called
libnjb: PDE (Portable Digital Entertainment protocol) at Creative. Newer
libnjb: devices using the Microsoft MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) are NOT
libnjb: supported. There are no kernel devices required for libnjb's
libnjb: operation, so instead it depends on user-level USB using libusb on
libnjb: all platforms.
