# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libtool-compat:
libtool-compat: This is GNU Libtool, a generic library support script. Libtool hides
libtool-compat: the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent, portable
libtool-compat: interface.  To use libtool-compat, add the new generic library building
libtool-compat: commands to your Makefile, Makefile.in, or Makefile.am.  See the
libtool-compat: documentation for details.
libtool-compat:
libtool-compat: This libtool-compat package contains the libtool v2 library without
libtool-compat: replacing the standard Slackware libtool package.
