libgalago: libgalago (Galago Presence Framework)
libgalago:
libgalago: Galago is a desktop presence framework, designed to transmit presence 
libgalago: information between programs. To put it in simpler terms, it takes 
libgalago: information on who is online and their away/idle states from an
libgalago: instant messenger (such as pidgin) or other similar programs and
libgalago: lets other programs (like Evolution) to make use of it.  The
libgalago: advantage of such a framework is that it brings your programs closer
libgalago: together. When you  receive an e-mail from a friend who is in your 
libgalago: buddy list, you'll be able to immediately tell their online status.
