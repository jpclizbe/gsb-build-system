# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

librest:
librest: librest has been designed to make it easier to access RESTful web 
librest: services, i.e., urls that represent remote objects which methods can 
librest: then be called on. RESTful end-points usually have an API
librest: that is simpler to use compared to other types of APIs they may 
librest: support (XML-RPC, for instance). It is this kind of API that this 
librest: library is attempting to support.
