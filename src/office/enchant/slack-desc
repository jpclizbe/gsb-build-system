enchant: enchant (Enchant Dictionary Library)
enchant: 
enchant: On the surface, Enchant appears to be a generic spell checking 
enchant: library. You can request dictionaries from it, ask if a word is 
enchant: correctly spelled, get corrections for a misspelled word, and so 
enchant: on. But beneath the surface, Enchant is a whole lot more - and 
enchant: less - than that. You'll see that Enchant isn't really a spell 
enchant: checking library at all. Enchant steps in to provide uniformity 
enchant: and conformity on top of other spelling libraries, and implement 
enchant: certain features that may be lacking in any individual provider 
enchant: library.
