devhelp: devhelp (GNOME Development Documentation Viewer)
devhelp:
devhelp: Devhelp's primary goal is to be an API documentation browser for GNOME. 
devhelp: When you build (or install) a GNOME library, it will build an API 
devhelp: reference for you and install it into /usr/share/gtk-doc/html. Along 
devhelp: with the HTML files, a .devhelp and/or .devhelp2 index file is also 
devhelp: generated automatically. Thus Devhelp can simply scan that folder for 
devhelp: those index files and display the books they represent.
