gtk-vnc: gtk-vnc (VNC Viewer Widgets for GTK)
gtk-vnc:
gtk-vnc: gtk-vnc provides a core library written in C for writing VNC 
gtk-vnc: applications in GTK, using coroutines to allow it to be completely 
gtk-vnc: asynchronous while remaining single threaded. The client is fully 
gtk-vnc: IPv6 aware, and as well as the traditional VNC authentication 
gtk-vnc: protocol, implements the VeNCrypt extension to provide secure 
gtk-vnc: TLS/SSL encrypted communications, optionally using x509 
gtk-vnc: certificates to authenticate.
