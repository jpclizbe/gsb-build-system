gob2: gob2 (GObject Builder) 
gob2:
gob2: GObject Builder is a simple preprocessor for easily creating GObject 
gob2: objects. It does not parse any C code and ignores any C errors. It is 
gob2: in spirit similar to things like lex or yacc. In some ways it also 
gob2: resembles java. But it is really just a simple preprocessor for
gob2: creating GObjects for use in C or C++ and it is not a programming
gob2: language.
