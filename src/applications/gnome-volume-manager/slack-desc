gnome-volume-manager: 
gnome-volume-manager: The gnome-volume-manager package contains a volume manager for 
gnome-volume-manager: GNOME. It is a desktop-level daemon that enforces volume-related 
gnome-volume-manager: policy in response to events received from HAL. This is useful for 
gnome-volume-manager: automatic mounting of floppy diskettes, CDROMs and removable storage 
gnome-volume-manager: devices. It can also be used to automatically run a program in response 
gnome-volume-manager: to other hotplug events such as plugging in USB printers or cameras, 
gnome-volume-manager: or inserting DVDs and music CDs. The goal of gnome-volume-manager is 
gnome-volume-manager: to implement all functionality as a state-machine in response to 
gnome-volume-manager: asynchronous events from HAL.
