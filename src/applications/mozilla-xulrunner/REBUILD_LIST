Note: Some apps linked against mozilla-xulrunner (our version is shared) may have hard coded runtime paths to gtkembodmoz, and these will need to be rebuilt when mozilla-xulrunner versions change.

These are:

epiphany (gecko)
epiphany-extensions
yelp (gtkmozembed)
devhelp (gtkmozembed)
seahorse (for nautilus plugin)
gnome-python-extras (for pygtkmoz)
gecko-sharp
totem (for mozilla plugin)
