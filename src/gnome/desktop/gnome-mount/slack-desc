gnome-mount: gnome-mount (GNOME Mounting Utility)
gnome-mount:
gnome-mount: The gnome-mount package contains programs for mounting, unmounting 
gnome-mount: and ejecting storage devices. The goal for gnome-mount is to get 
gnome-mount: the appropriate GNOME software (such as gnome-volume-manager and 
gnome-mount: GNOME-VFS) to use this instead of invoking mount/umount/eject or 
gnome-mount: direct HAL invoking methods. All the gnome-mount programs utilize 
gnome-mount: the methods on HAL and as such run unprivileged. The rationale for 
gnome-mount: gnome-mount is to have a centralized place (in GConf) where settings 
gnome-mount: (e.g., mount options and mount locations) are maintained.
