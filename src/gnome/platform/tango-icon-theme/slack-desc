tango-icon-theme: 
tango-icon-theme: The Tango! icon theme is a basic set of desktop icons that follow 
tango-icon-theme: the Tango Open Desktop style guidelines. The set has been created 
tango-icon-theme: as a proof of concept for the style, but works rather well as a 
tango-icon-theme: replacement for the base theme under GNOME.
