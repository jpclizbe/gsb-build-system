shared-mime-info: shared-mime-info (Common mime types database)
shared-mime-info:
shared-mime-info: This package contains the core database of common types and the
shared-mime-info: update-mime-database command used to extend it. It requires glib2 to
shared-mime-info: be installed for building the update command. Additionally, it uses
shared-mime-info: intltool for translations, though this is only a dependency for the
shared-mime-info: maintainers.
