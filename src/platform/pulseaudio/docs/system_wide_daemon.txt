Starting with PulseAudio 0.9.3 the daemon can be run as a system-wide instance which than can be shared by multiple local users. We recommend running the PulseAudio daemon per-user, just like the traditional ESD sound daemon. In some situations however, such as systems where multiple users are logged in at the same time, or embedded systems where no real notion of a user exists, it makes sense to use the system-wide mode.

To run PulseAudio in system-wide mode, start it as root and pass the --system argument to it. It will then drop priviliges and change to the pulse UNIX user and group. The directory /var/run/pulse/ is used as home directory. In this mode the module module-native-protocol-unix will automatically allow access to all members of the group pulse-access. All user/group names and paths can be changed by passing compile-time arguments to configure. The system user pulse and the groups pulse and pulse-access need to be created manually.
