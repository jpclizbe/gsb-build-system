system-tools-backends:
system-tools-backends: The System Tools Backends (s-t-b for short) are a set of cross-platform
system-tools-backends: modules for Linux, FreeBSD and other Unix systems. The backends provide 
system-tools-backends: an common DBus interface to all platforms to modify or read the system 
system-tools-backends: configuration in a distro independent fashion. Historically, access to 
system-tools-backends: system configuration has varied deeply across Unix flavours, and concreting 
system-tools-backends: a bit more, across Linux distributions, making it near impossible to write 
system-tools-backends: desktop tools that could work flawlessly in a cross-platform way. System 
system-tools-backends: Tools Backends try to fill this gap, offering a generic and easy way for
system-tools-backends: desktop applications to read and modify configuration details.
