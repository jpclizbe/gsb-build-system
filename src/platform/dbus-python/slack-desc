dbus-python: dbus-python (D-BUS Python Bindings)
dbus-python:
dbus-python: D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware
dbus-python: device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per user login
dbus-python: session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications).
dbus-python: Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message
dbus-python: passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate
dbus-python: directly (without going through the message bus daemon).
dbus-python:
dbus-python: This package contains Python bindings for D-Bus.
