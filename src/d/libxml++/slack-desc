libxml++: libxml++ (C++ Bindings for XML Parser Library)
libxml++:
libxml++: Libxml++ is a C++ wrapper for the libxml XML parser library. It has 
libxml++: SAX and DOM-like APIs, but does not attempt to conform exactly to 
libxml++: the DOM specifications because they are not aimed at C++. Its API is 
libxml++: much simpler than the underlying libxml C API.
