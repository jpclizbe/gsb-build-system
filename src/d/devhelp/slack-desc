devhelp: devhelp (GNOME Development Documentation Viewer)
devhelp:
devhelp: Devhelp's primary goal is to be an API documentation browser for
devhelp: GNOME. When you build (or install) a GNOME library, it will build 
devhelp: an API reference for you and install it into /usr/share/gtk-doc/html.
devhelp: Along with the HTML files, a .devhelp and/or .devhelp2 index file is
devhelp: also generated automatically. Thus Devhelp can simply scan that
devhelp: folder for those index files and display the books they represent.
